# Introduction
Warcraft is one of the most successful and popular fantasy video game franchises of all time. Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition is one of the most successful and popular fantasy taletop role-playing games of all time. Frankly, it's a crime that there's not an official collaboration between them! In light of this glaring absence, various creators have embarked on their own homebrew projects to bring the world of Azeroth to 5E, such as the (deservedly!) popular [Warcraft 5E](https://www.reddit.com/r/wc5e/), or the recent Blood and Thunder work-in-progress by [Wyatt Trull](https://www.reddit.com/user/sigrisvaali/posts/). *Champions of Azeroth* is my own humble contribution to this endeavor.

### Design Principles
My design principles for *Champions of Azeroth* are:

- Start with D&D 5E, change things only when necessary, and add on everything else needed for a Warcraft adaptation. In practice, this generally means starting with a 5E class, add some extra Warcraft flavor and/or utility features, and write new Warcraft subclasses.
- Keep it simple. There is a tremendous amount of content in Warcraft, and you could go mad trying to do a totally faithful implementation of any Warcraft class. I tried to pick simple core fantasies and mechanics to build around, even if that means leaving a lot of inspiration unused.
- Stick to 5E design principles and mechanics. 5E does things certain ways (e.g., favoring advantage over static roll bonuses), and by now has done a lot of things in a lot of different ways. Use those principles and mechanics whenever possible, and don't go against them.
- Make sure that things using 5E vocabulary are unchanged, and things named similarly should be recognizable. Warlocks should have the same core design as 5E warlocks, mages should be based on wizards, *barkskin* is still the same terrible spell, etc. There are inevitably going to be exceptions, but they should be few and far between.
- Don't neglect utility or roleplay. Given the *Warcraft* inspiration, it can be tempting to just focus on cool combat features. But part of the joy of a 5E adaptation is getting to interact with Azeroth outside of video game fighting. I want to make sure that the design engages with the full 5E experience, not just combat.

### On Balance
Relative to 5E, the goal of *Champions of Azeroth* material is to be more **internally consistent** while **not changing the upper bounds** of character power. In other words, while the average *Champions* character might be more powerful than the average 5E character, there should be less variance between the power of average *Champions* characters, and nothing should exceed the optimized builds already possible in 5E. Note that *power* here doesn't just refer to damage numbers, but also to utility, support, etc. In particular, several classes lacking baseline support/utility capabilities have gained them (warrior and rogue, for example)---such buffs were a good way to deliver classic *Warcraft* fantasy, while also elevating these classes to my desired balance level.

<div style='margin-top:200px;'></div>

### What This Is
*Champions of Azeroth* provides a plethora of new content to play 5E in Azeroth (or its various associated planes, worlds, and so on). It provides completely new *Warcraft*-inspired races and classes, as well as new equipment, feats, spells, and more. It is not a complete replacement for 5E---you'll still use 5E rules, spells, equipment, monsters, etc. That material is not reproduced here. You'll need at least the 5E *Player's Handbook* to play, but the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, *Monster Manual*, *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, and *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* are also recommended.

### Stuff Is Missing!
It sure is! To make things more manageable for myself, I'm going to divide my revised content up by *World of Warcraft* expansion. This document contains only "classic" content, and future supplements will add additional races, classes, feats, etc. pertaining (roughly) to specific expansions.

Whether as a stalwart defender of the Alliance or a fierce guardian of the Horde, deciding which race to play will define who you'll fight for in this neverending war. Where do your loyalties lie?

## Alliance Races
The steadfast Alliance is driven by tradition. They are staunch defenders of justice and duty who protect Azeroth against any aggressors, including the savage Horde.

### Human
Humans are a young race, and thus highly versatile, mastering the arts of combat, craftsmanship, and magic with stunning efficiency. The humans' valor and optimism have led them to build some of the world's greatest kingdoms.

Then records surfaced of a god-like race said to have given the dwarves life... and an enchanted birthright.

### Night Elf
Ten thousand years ago, the kaldorei, or night elves, founded a vast empire, but their reckless use of primal magic brought them to ruin. In grief, they withdrew to the forests and remained isolated there until the return of their ancient enemy, the Burning Legion. With no other choice, the night elves emerged at last from their seclusion to fight for their place in the new world. With bow, blade, or claw, night elves are fierce defenders of the natural world, and unforgiving enemies of those that would abuse it.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Night elves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until their second or third centuries of life. Many night elves have been alive since before the Sundering, and the true length of their now-mortal lifespan is not yet known (though it is likely several thousand years, similar to their elf kin).

***Alignment.*** Night elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. As protectors of the natural world, with all its untamed beauty and primal cruelty, night elves tend towards neutrality over good and evil.

### Gnome
Clever and eccentric, gnomes are a race of tiny tinkerers, trailblazers, and technological geniuses, renowned for their intellect and radical ideas. Indeed, their subterranean kingdom, Gnomeregan, was once a marvel of steam-driven technology. Even so, due to a massive trogg invasion, the city was lost. Now its builders are vagabonds in the dwarven lands, aiding their allies as best they can. Only fools dismiss the diminutive gnomes, who have distinguished themselves time and time again with their ingenuity, bravery, and loyalty.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.

***Alignment.*** Gnomes are most often good. Those who lend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.

***Size.*** Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Gnome Cunning.*** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

***Engineer's Lore.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish.

***Subrace.*** While exiled from their home, several subraces of gnomes have developed---or been discovered. The traits of gnomes hailing from their home city of Gnomeregan are listed below.

#### Gnomeregan Gnome
Originally, gnomes thrived in their wondrous techno-city of Gnomeregan, pursuing their ambitions while contributing ingenious weapons to aid the Alliance in its fierce battles against the Horde. Exile hasn't dampened their spirits or brilliance in the slightest. Gnomeregan gnomes serve the Alliance with their ingenuity and agility, their minds as nimble as their reflexes.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your choice of Dexterity or Charisma increases by 1.

***Tool Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: alchemist's supplies or tinker's tools.

***Escape Artist.*** You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action on each of your turns. You also have advantage on rolls made to avoid being grappled or restrained, or to escape from those conditions. 

***Expansive Mind.*** You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any Intelligence check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

## Horde Races

The indomitable Horde is driven by unity. They are fervent keepers of freedom and hope, relentlessly opposed to any who threaten these ideals, including the stringent Alliance.

### Orc
The orc race originated on the planet Draenor. A peaceful people with shamanic beliefs, they were enslaved by the Burning Legion and forced into war with the humans of Azeroth. Although it took many years, the orcs finally escaped the demons' corruption and won their freedom. To this day they fight for honor in an alien world that hates and reviles them, having forged a new home and family in the mighty Horde. Orcs remain fierce and eager for battle, valuing strength and honor above all.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Orcs reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

***Alignment.*** Orcs believe in honor and strength above all, and tend towards the more violent sides of chaos. Free from demonic corruption, orcs do not favor good or evil in general.

***Size.*** Orcs are usually over 6 feet tall and weigh between 250 and 300 pounds on average. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Hardiness.*** Whenever you would gain levels of exhaustion, you can reduce the number of levels gained by one. After you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

***Relentless Endurance.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Orcish and one extra language of your choice.

***Subrace.*** Thoughout their history of war and violence, different subraces of orcs have emerged. The traits of orcs from the newly-founded nation of Durotar are listed below.

#### Durotar Orc
The nation of Durotar was founded by warchief Thrall after the Third War to be a new home for his people. While free from demonic corruption, Durotar orcs still possess a terrible bloodlust, and have had to adapt to their harsh new surroundings to protect their new home.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your choice of Constitution or Wisdom increases by 1.

***Blood Fury.*** Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to give into your bloodlust. When you do so, other creatures within 10 feet of you that you can see you must each succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

***Rugged Survivalist.*** You gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, and Survival.

### Undead
Free of the Lich King's grasp, the Forsaken seek to overthrow his rule. Led by the banshee queen Sylvanas, they hunger for vengeance against the Scourge. Humans, too, have become the enemy, relentless in their drive to purge all undead from the land. Many Forsaken care little for their allies: to them the Horde is merely a tool that may further their dark schemes. But for other Forsaken, the Horde offers a new home, willing to accept them despite their undead nature. Forsaken use their cunning and ruthlessness to defeat their enemies and achieve their goals.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Undead remain at the age they originally died, sustained by the dark magic that raised them. If uncared for, however, their corpses will wither and decay over time.

***Alignment.*** Undead are ruthless and know that they can trust only themselves in a world that reviles them. They tend towards non-good alignments, though there are many exceptions.

***Size.*** Undead retain the height, weight, and size of their original race, though they often become gaunt and hunched.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Undead Nature.***  Your type is both humanoid and undead, meaning you are affected by any features or abilities that affect either of those types. For example, you can be targeted by *hold person* or affected by *shackle undead*. You also gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
- You have advantage on death saving throws.
- You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Orcish and Gutterspeak.

***Subrace.*** The Scourge has raised many of its victims to serve the Lich King in undeath. The traits of undead humans are listed below.

#### Undead Human
Humans suffered the most during the march of the Scourge, and many were raised to serve the Lich King. Now free, they form the bulk of the Forsaken, banding together for the sake of survival and vengeance. Undead humans retain the relentless drive they possessed in life, though they apply it towards dark and sinister ends.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Three different ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

***The Human Spirit.*** When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

### Tauren
The tauren strive to preserve the balance of nature and heed the will of the Earth Mother. Recently attacked by murderous centaur, the tauren would have been wiped out, save for a chance encounter with the orcs, who helped defeat the interlopers. To honor this blood-debt, the tauren joined the Horde. They live honorable lives and value peace over the warmongering ways of their allies. Yet once roused, tauren prove themselves to be mighty warriors and defenders.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Tauren are mature by their mid teens, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. They can live up to 150 years.

***Alignment.*** As people who follow the rhythm of nature and work to preserve its balance, tauren are often neutral good.

***Size.*** Tauren are between 9 and 10 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 400 pounds on average. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Brawn.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

***Horns.*** Your horns are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. They deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Hammering Horns.*** Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove that target with your horns. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and within 5 feet of you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice), you push it up to 10 feet away from you.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Orcish and Taur-ahe.

***Subrace.*** Tauren can be found all across Azeroth. The traits of Mulgore tauren are listed below.

#### Mulgore Tauren
The peaceful tauren have long dwelled in Kalimdor, striving to preserve the balance of nature at the behest of their goddess, the Earth Mother. Until recently, the tauren lived as nomads scattered throughout the Barrens, but recently they have settled more permanently on the grassy plains of Mulgore. These tauren are both mighty and wise, slow to anger but not afraid to defend the works of the Earth Mother.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your choice of Strength or Wisdom increases by 1.

***Tool Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency with either leatherworker's tools or the herbalism kit.

***Endurance.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.

***War Stomp.*** You can cast *earth tremor* once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Strength or Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell. When you cast *earth tremor* with this feature, you add your level to its damage roll. You can also cast this spell using any spells slots you have.

### Troll
Once at home in the jungles of Stranglethorn Vale, the fierce trolls of the Darkspear tribe were pushed out by warring factions. Eventually the trolls befriended the orcish Horde, and Thrall, the orcs' young warchief, convinced the trolls to travel with him to Kalimdor. Though they cling to their shadowy heritage, the Darkspear trolls hold a place of honor in the Horde. Trolls are cunning, ruthless, and savage, eager to defend themselves and their allies---by any means necessary.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Trolls reach adulthood in their mid teens and live up to 80 years.

***Alignment.*** Trolls are loyal to their tribes but are also fiercely independent, and continue to embrace their dark traditions. They tend towards non-good alignments.

***Size.*** Trolls stand between 8' and 9' tall when upright, and weigh around 200 pounds on average. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Regeneration.*** As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend one Hit Die to heal yourself. Roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1).

You are also able to naturally heal from grievous wounds, even regenerating lost limbs and organs. You heal such injuries after one full week of remaining above 1 hit point.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Orcish and Zandali.

***Subrace.*** Trolls are an ancient race, with numerous subraces spread across Azeroth. The traits of jungle trolls are listed below.

#### Jungle Troll
Jungle trolls originate in the wilds of Stranglethorn Vale, where they once ruled over the great Gurubashi Empire. Only the Darkspear Tribe retains any prominence, thanks to its alliance with the Horde. Jungle trolls are superstitious creatures who revel in the hunt and practice dark rituals to earn the favor of the Loa.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your choice of Wisdom or Charisma increases by 1. 

***Da Voodoo Shuffle.*** Your base walking speed increases by 5 feet, and moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

***Headhunter.*** You gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.

***Savage Attacks.*** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

# Chapter 2: Classes
As in D&D 5E, class is the primary defining element of your character, and determine most of what they can do. The classes detailed here are adapted from D&D 5E to implement and evoke *World of Warcraft* classes. In some cases the adaptation is obvious and straightforward; the rogue, for example, is essentially the same as the 5E rogue. In other cases the adaptation takes a 5E class and adds on essential new features, such as how the warrior is essentially a 5E fighter with rage. But sometimes a class has to be more heavily adapted to deliver a Warcraft experience; the shaman is based on the 5E cleric, but has been changed significantly from that starting point. In all cases, new subclasses have been written corresponding to *World of Warcraft* class specializations. Classes rarely implement *World of Warcraft* mechanics directly, but instead try to capture the fantasy and experience of the game using sound 5E principles.

\columnbreak

> ##### Race/Class Restrictions?
> In *World of Warcraft*, certain classes are limited to certain races. Given that the exact list has changed over time, *Champions of Azeroth* does not attempt to present any such rules. DMs are encouraged to work with players to make sure their characters are appropriate for their particular game, using race/class restrictions specific to their game's specific era—or even none at all!

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

&emsp;The original 9 *World of Warcraft* classes are presented here. Additional classes and subclasses will be presented in future supplements: the demon hunter in *Champions of Outland*, the death knight in *Champions of Northrend*, and the monk in *Champions of Pandaria*.

## Druid
Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience, druids can unleash nature's raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones. Druids can also direct this power to heal wounds and restore life to fallen allies. As master shapeshifters, druids can take on the forms of a variety of beasts, morphing into a bear, cat, storm crow, or sea lion with ease. These keepers of the natural order are among the most versatile heroes in Azeroth.

As a druid, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per druid level

### Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.

### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See Chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting, and Chapter 5 for the druid spell list and new spells.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

\columnbreak

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

\pagebreakNum

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

 <font face='scalysans' size='2'>
 
 <center> 
 
 **Spell save DC** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
 
 </center>
 
 <div style='margin-top:-8px'></div>
 
 <center> your Wisdom modifier </center>
 
 <div style='margin-top:8px'></div>
 
 <center>
 
 **Spell attack modifier** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> your proficiency bonus + 
 
 </center>
 
 <div style='margin-top:-8px'></div>
 
 <center> your Wisdom modifier </center>
 
 </font>
 
 <div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

### Spirit Shape
You can use your action to magically assume the shape of one of several mighty beast spirits. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

You can initially assume the form of a Spirit of the Claw and Spirit of the Fang. At 4th level you can assume the form of a Spirit of the Waves, and at 8th level you can assume the form of a Spirit of the Talon. Your druid specialization may allow you to shapeshift into additional forms. The stat blocks for your druid forms can be found in appendix A.

You can stay in a spirit form for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (minimum of  one hour). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the spirit form, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the spirit. If the spirit has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the spirit's bonus instead of yours.
- When you transform, your current and maximum hit points do not change, and any damage taken while in a spirit form carries over to your normal form.
- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your spirit form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast.

\columnbreak

> ##### Spirit Forms
> Different druid traditions manifest their spirit shapes in different ways. Some common manifestations are listed below, or you can work with your DM to determine your own spirit shapes.
>
> - ***Spirits of Life*** include treants and other plant-like forms.
> - ***Spirits of the Claw*** include mighty beasts like bears and ankylosauruses.
> - ***Spirits of the Fang*** include deadly beasts like panthers and lions.
> - ***Spirits of the Stars*** include moonkin and astral forms.
> - ***Spirits of the Talon*** include winged beasts like crows and hawks.
> - ***Spirits of the Waves*** include aquatic beasts like sea lions and orca.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the spirit's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

### Wild Gifts
Your growing affinity with nature has changed you. You have learned secret techniques called wild gifts, blessings of nature that empower, change, or draw on your shapeshifting abilities in different ways. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

At 2nd level, you gain two wild gifts of your choice. Your gift options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain druid levels, you gain additional gifts of your choice, as shown in the Gifts Known column of the Druid table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gifts you know and replace it with another gift that you could learn at that level.

### Druid Specialization
At 3rd level, you choose to identify with an ancient and powerful druidic tradition. Choose Balance, Feral, or Restoration, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

<br>

\columnbreak

#### Specialization Spells
Each specialization has a list of spells---its specialization spells---that you gain at the druid levels noted in the specialization description. Once you gain a specialization spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a specialization spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Timeless Body
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

### Soul of the Forest
Also at 18th level, you are beloved by nature's children. Any beast, fey, or plant that targets you with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This feature doesn't protect you from area effects, such as the explosion of a *fireball*.

If you make an attack or cast a harmful spell that affects an enemy beast, fey, or plant, that creature is immune to this feature until you finish a long rest.

### Incarnation
At 20th level, you are briefly able to channel the mighty power of the Ancients. You can use your bonus action to cast *guardian of nature* (found in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*), which does not require your concentration to maintain. In addition, while using Spirit Shape, the form's innate weapon attacks are considered both Strength and Dexterity-based for the purposes of *guardian of nature* (their stats remain unchanged) and you gain the additional Incarnation benefit listed in the form's stat block.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Druid Specializations
Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other. Your specialization reflects your role in druidic society, and how you have chosen to safeguard the wilds.

\pagebreakNum

### Balance Specialization
Balance druids unleash the power of the sun, moon, and stars on their enemies.

#### Balance Specialization Spells
| Druid Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;*moonbeam*, ✦ *moonfire/sunfire* |	
| 5th | &ensp; *daylight*, ✦ *faerie swarm* |

| 9th | &ensp;✦ *force of nature*, ✦ *lunar fury* |	
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.

#### Natural Recovery
Also at 3rd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

#### Spirit of the Stars
At 6th level, you can use Spirit Shape to adopt the form of a powerful Spirit of the Stars. Transforming into this form does not count against the uses of your Spirit Shape feature.

#### Celestial Blessing
At 10th level, you have been blessed by the sun and moon. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following blessings, which lasts until you finish your next rest.

***Blessing of the Sun.*** Empowered by the shining sun, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In addition, whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn't have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it.

***Blessing of the Moon.*** Empowered by the ever-changing moon, you have darkvision out to a range of 300 feet. In that radius, you can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. In addition, when you make a saving throw to resist the effects of a spell and don't have disadvantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to give yourself advantage on it.

#### Twin Moons
Starting at 14th level, when you cast a druid cantrip or druid spell of 1st through 5th level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, the druid must provide them for each target.

***Spirit of the Claw.*** You have aligned yourself with the mighty Spirits of the Claw, and gain the following benefits:
- Transforming into a Spirit of the Claw does not count against the uses of your Spirit Shape feature.

#### Strength of the Wild
Beginning at 6th level, once on your turn when you make a weapon attack, you can make an additional weapon attack as part of the same action.

In addition, your attacks in spirit shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Finally, you learn to channel your spiritual power in new and savage ways. While shapeshifted, you may use your spell slots to do the following:

***Ferocious Bite.*** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal extra damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. 

***Frenzied Regeneration.*** You can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

#### Omen of Clarity
At 10th level, you can use this feature on your turn (no action required) to be able to cast spells even while shapeshifted, until the end of your turn. During this time, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. In addition, while using this feature you can treat spells with a casting time of 1 action as if their casting time is 1 bonus action instead.

&emsp;Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Heart of the Wild
When you reach 14th level, you have been blessed with the power of the Ancients. You gain one of the following features, depending on your favored form:

***Spirit of the Claw: Nature's Guardian.*** Your Spirit of the Claw form gains resistance to all damage except psychic damage.

***Spirit of the Fang: Razor Claws.*** When you deal extra damage to a target with your Spirit of the Fang's Ravage feature, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, its speed is halved and it has disadvantage on ability checks until the end of its next turn, at which time it takes your Ravage damage again.

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Lifebloom
Also at 3rd level, you learn to instinctually harness the rejuvenating magic of nature. You have a pool of healing energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level. As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.

You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

\pagebreakNum

#### Spirit of Life
At 6th level, you can use Spirit Shape to adopt the form of a powerful Spirit of Life. Transforming into this form does not count against the uses of your Spirit Shape feature.

#### Innervate
When you reach 10th level, you can infuse allies with life magic to bolster their spirits. As an action, you choose a creature within 60 feet that you can seeand confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature:

- For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a d4 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll, as if under the effect of the *bless* spell.
- Roll a d4. The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals the number rolled or lower (the creature's choice). Once a
creature receives this benefit, that creature can't receive it again until after a long rest.

You can take this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Overgrowth
At 14th level, your spirit overflows with life energy. When you a heal a target with Lifebloom, roll 1d6, and add the result to the total amount healed and temporary hit points gained.

You can use Spirit Shape to transform into any beast of CR 2 or lower. Doing so follows the normal rules for Spirit Shape, except that you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.

\columnbreak

#### Waking Dream
You no longer need to sleep and can't be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity, such as meditating and keeping watch.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level (minimum of one hour).

#### Wild Speech
You can cast *speak with animals* at will, ignoring its components. You can cast this spell even while using your Spirit Shape feature, in which case you can also communicate with any creature that you share a common language with.

#### Wings of the Moon

<div style='margin-top:-10px;'></div>
</div>

### Trailblazer
You can move quickly, alertly, and stealthily, both alone and with companions. Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. In addition, you gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more:

- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel pace.
- Your group doesn't suffer the penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores imposed by traveling at a fast pace.
- Your group can travel stealthily even at a normal pace.

### Hunting Tactics
Also at 1st level, you decide whether you hunt your quarry alone, or wander the wilds with a loyal animal companion by your side. Choose one of the following features.

#### Lone Wolf
You are able to focus your cunning and expertise fully on your chosen quarry, to deadly effect. As a bonus action, you can mark a creature you can see within 120 feet as your quarry. If you possess physical traces of a creature such as blood, a lock of hair, a body part, or the like, you can mark a creature even if they aren't visible or within range. For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:

\columnbreak

- Once per round, when you hit the marked target with a weapon attack, you can deal an additional 1d4 damage to it. This damage increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and 1d12 at 17th level.
- You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find the marked creature.

You may maintain only one mark at a time; if you use this feature to mark a new creature, your previous mark fades immediately. You may end a mark at any time (no action required). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. 

At 6th level, your mark lasts until you finish a long rest. Whenever a creature you have marked forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target's grapple, you have advantage on the roll. You also gain an additional focus die.

At 14th level, your mark lasts indefinitely. If you miss with an attack roll against a marked target, you can turn the miss into a hit. You must finish a long rest before you can use this ability on the same creature again. You also gain another additional focus die.

\pagebreakNum

#### Animal Companion
You have a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and fights alongside you. Your pet is either a Beast of the Land or a Beast of the Sky, though you determine what kind of specific animal it is (for example, a wolf, bear, or any other animal your DM deems appropriate). The stat blocks for these creatures can be found in appendix B, and use your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You also choose one of the special traits listed in the "Pet Talents" side bar for it.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

> ##### Pet Talents
> Your pet knows one of the special talents below at 1st level, and learns an additional talent at 6th level. The pets of beast master hunters learn a talent when that specialization is chosen at 3rd level.
>
> ***Armored hide.*** The beast has +2 to its AC, and resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
>
> ***Charge.*** If the beast moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with an attack on the same turn, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your hunter focus save DC or be knocked prone.
> 
> ***Constrictor.*** When the beast deals damage with its innate attack, the target is grappled (escape DC equal to your hunter focus save DC). Until this grapple ends, the beast can't attack a different target. The beast can grapple a creature at most one size larger than itself.
>
> ***Dire.*** The beast is one size larger, and has an additional number of hit points equal to twice your hunter level.
> 
> ***Enhanced senses.*** The beast doubles the proficiency bonus added to its Wisdom (Perception) rolls and can't be surprised. It also has either tremorsense (Beast of the Land) or blindsight (Beast of the Sky) out to a range of 60 feet.
> 
> ***Pack tactics.*** The beast has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the beast's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
> 
> ***Poisonous.*** Once per turn, the beast may try to poison a creature damaged by its innate attack. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your hunter focus save DC or be poisoned until the end of the beast's next turn.
> 
> ***Protector.*** The first creature the beast attacks on its turn has disadvantage on any attack roll it makes on a target other than the beast, until the end of the beast's next turn.
> 
> ***Prowl.*** The beast may add your proficiency bonus to its Dexterity (Stealth) rolls. In addition, any hit the beast scores against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
> 
> ***Swift.*** Add 20 feet to the beast's walking speed (Beast of the Land) or flying speed (Beast of the Sky). In addition, the beast doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it moves out of an enemy's reach.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

\columnbreak

&emsp;In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If your animal companion dies, it revives at the end of a short rest with 1 hit point. The companion is allowed to spend its Hit Dice to regain additional hit points when it revives. A dead animal companion also revives at the end of a long rest with full hit points.

You may only have one animal companion at a time. If you befriend a beast (for example, through the use of the Animal Handling skill or *animal friendship* spell) and wish to make it your animal companion, you can do so at the end of a short rest, at which point your previous pet leaves peacefully. You choose whether your new animal companion is a Beast of the Land or a Beast of the Sky, along with new talents for it.

At 6th level, your pet's innate attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You may also choose another pet talent for it. Finally, you may cast *beast sense* on your animal companion at will.

At 14th level, when your pet is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose for it to be restored to half its maximum hit points instead. Your pet can't use this ability again until you finish a long rest.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. 

You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery 
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Defense  
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling  
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting  
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Rapid Reloading
You ignore the loading property of ranged weapons you are proficient in.

In addition, when you roll a 1 on a damage die for an attack you make with a ranged weapon, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1.

<div style='margin-top:450px;'></div>

> ##### Additional Fighting Styles
> If you own *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, you can ask your DM if you can take the optional ranger fighting styles detailed within, in addition to the fighting styles listed here.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

#### Two-Weapon Fighting  
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Versatile Weapon Fighting
When you are wielding a single versatile weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon.

In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to AC if you are wielding that weapon with two hands.

### Focus
When you reach 2nd level, you learn to use cunning techniques that are fueled by special dice called focus dice.

#### Focus Dice
You have two focus dice, which are d6s. A focus die is expended when you use it on a focus technique. You regain all of your expended dice when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain additional focus dice as you level, as shown in the Focus Dice column of the Hunter table. Your focus dice become d8s at 5th level, d10s at 9th level, and d12s at 17th level, as shown in the Focus Die Size column of the Hunter table.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:490px;'></div>

#### Focus Techniques
You learn two focus techniques of your choice, which are detailed under "Focus Techniques" at the end of the hunter class description. You also know the Call of the Wild technique, which does not count against your number of techniques known. Many techniques enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one technique per attack.

You learn additional techniques at the levels shown in the Techniques Known column of the Hunter table. Each time you gain a hunter level, you can also replace one technique you know with a different one.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your focus techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

 <font face='scalysans' size='2'>
 
 <center> 
 
 **Focus save DC** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
 
 </center>
 
 <div style='margin-top:-8px'></div>
 
 <center> your Wisdom modifier </center>
 
 <div style='margin-top:8px'></div>
 
 <center>
 
 **Focus attack modifier** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> your proficiency bonus + 
 
 </center>
 
 <div style='margin-top:-8px'></div>
 
 <center> your Wisdom modifier </center>
 
 </font>
 
  <div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

### Hunter Specialization
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Beast Mastery, Marksmanship, or Survival, all of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

\pagebreakNum

### Wild Lore
Also at 3rd level, your connection with the wilds allows you to cast certain spells.  See chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting, and chapter 5 for new spells. You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your Wild Lore spells. If a Wild Lore spell requires a spell attack roll or saving throw, it uses your focus attack modifier or focus save DC.

You can use this feature to cast spells a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest. You can also use your Wild Lore feature by expending one focus die per level of the spell you wish to cast. This does not count against your normal uses of this feature.

You are initially able to cast *animal friendship*, and are able to cast additional spells as you gain hunter levels, as shown in the table below. Your choice of hunter specialization also grants you additional Wild Lore spells.

#### Wild Lore Spells
| Hunter Level | &nbsp;&nbsp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &nbsp;&nbsp;*animal friendship* |
| 5th | &nbsp;&nbsp;*locate animals or plants* |
| 9th | &nbsp;&nbsp;✦ *flare* |
| 13th | &nbsp;&nbsp;*locate creature* |
| 17th | &nbsp;&nbsp;*commune with nature* |
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

> ##### Wild Lore and You
> Different hunters manifest their Wild Lore spellcasting in different ways, based on their heritage and training. For example, night elf marksmanship hunters commonly call upon ethereal sentinel owls to accomplish their divination spells, while troll survival hunters might call upon mighty animal loa to cast *enhance ability.* Feel free to work with your DM to determine the specific details of your own Wild Lore spellcasting.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Animal Aspect
At 6th level, you learn to emulate a beast of the wild. Choose one of the aspects listed below. You learn an additional aspect at 10th and 14th level.

You can use the Hide action as a bonus action, and you can try to hide when you are only lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.

#### Aspect of the Cheetah
Your speed increases by 10 feet, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action.

### Camouflage
When you reach 10th level, you are able to blend in with your surroundings with almost supernatural skill. Creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect you, provided you have moved at most half your speed since the beginning of your most recent turn. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden.

In addition, when traveling at a slow pace for an hour or more, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect your group have disadvantage.

### Readiness
Starting at 13th level, when you roll initiative and have no focus dice remaining, you regain one focus die.

### Feral Senses
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Foe Slayer
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against an enemy. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

#### Rapid Fire
At 15th level, you can use your bonus action to dramatically increase your coordination and reflexes. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- Once on your turn when you make a ranged weapon attack, you can make an additional ranged weapon attack against the same target with the same weapon.

- When you target a creature with a trap, it has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against the trap.

#### Alpha Predator
At 15th level, you can use your bonus action to greatly improve your hunting prowess for a short time. For 1 minute, you may perform one focus technique that you know for free on your turn, using but not expending a focus die. During this time, enemy creatures within 20 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your focus techniques.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Survival Gear
The survival gear options are presented in alphabetical order.

The creature can make a new Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer poisoned.

## Mage
Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The arcane magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, magi wear little armor, but arcane shields and enchantments give them additional protection. Magi can summon bursts of fire to incinerate distant targets and cause entire areas to erupt, command blizzards that tear into flesh and limit movement, even shrink their enemies into harmless sheep in the blink of an eye.

### Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you can cast powerful spells. See chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting, and chapter 5 for the mage spell list and new spells.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list. You learn additional mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mage table.

#### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level mage spells of your choice. This book holds the mage spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your mage spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended slots when you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

&emsp;You prepare the list of mage spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of mage spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your mage level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you're a 3rd-level mage, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *magic missile*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of mage spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your mage spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

\pagebreakNum

&emsp;In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

 <font face='scalysans' size='2'>
 
 <center> 
 
 **Spell save DC** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
 
 </center>
 
 <div style='margin-top:-8px'></div>
 
 <center> your Intelligence modifier </center>
 
 <div style='margin-top:8px'></div>

 **Spell attack modifier** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> your proficiency bonus + 
 
 </center>
 
 <div style='margin-top:-8px'></div>
 
 <center> your Intelligence modifier </center>
 
 </font>
 
  <div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your mage spells.

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain a mage level, you can add two mage spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Mage table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).

### Evocation
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your mage level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level mage, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

\columnbreak

> ##### Your Spellbook
> 
> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil mage's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
> 
> ***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a mage spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
> 
> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the mage who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
> 
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
> 
> ***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
> 
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many mages keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
> 
> ***The Book's Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

### Mage Specialization
When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of three elemental specializations: Arcane, Fire, or Frost. The tradition you choose reflects not just your favored element, but how you approach the study of magic in general.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

\pagebreakNum

### Arcane Brilliance
At 3rd level, your brilliant intellect allows you to achieve feats of staggering genius. You can expend a use of this feature to do any of the following:

- You can cast a spell in your spellbook even if you don't have it prepared, but otherwise following the normal rules for casting it.
- When you cast a mage spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it.
- When you make an Intelligence check but before the outcome is determined, you can choose to make the roll again, using the better result.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

At 11th level, when you finish a short rest, you regain one expended use of this feature.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Spell Mastery
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level mage spell and a 2nd-level mage spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

### Signature Spells
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level mage spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## Mage Specializations
Mages in Azeroth focus their studies on one of three schools of magic---Arcane, Fire, and Frost. Each imparts advanced techniques for harnessing magic in increasingly powerful ways. The specialization you choose reflects your approach.

\columnbreak

### Arcane
Arcane mages manipulate the pure essence of magic itself, augmenting their spellcasting and turning the magic of their foes against them.

#### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this specialization at 2nd level, you gain the *prestidigitation* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of mage cantrips you know.

#### Arcane Power
Also at 2nd level, you learn how to salvage some of your spent magic for later use. When you cast a spell using a spell slot, you gain a number of arcane charges equal to half the spell's level, rounded up. You can have a maximum of five arcane charges at once, and all accumulated charges dissipate when you finish a short or long rest.

Before you roll damage for a spell, you can spend arcane charges to set a number of the spell's damage dice equal to their maximum value, up to the number of arcane charges spent. When you spend arcane charges on a spell, that spell does not also generate arcane charges.

#### Savant
Beginning at 6th level, when you use your Evocation feature, the combined level of spell slots you may recover increases by half your proficiency bonus.

#### Prismatic Barrier
When you reach 10th level, you learn how to siphon arcane energy from harmful magic for your own benefit. When you make a saving throw against a spell, you can use your reaction to give yourself advantage on the roll. On a failed save, you suffer the spell's effect, but take only half damage (if any). On a successful save, you take no damage from the spell. Regardless of whether your saving throw succeeds or fails, you gain arcane charges as if you had cast the spell.

After using this feature, you can use it again only after finishing a short or long rest.

#### Overpowered
At 14th level, you have mastered the use of your arcane charges for both offense and defense. When you spend arcane charges, you may maximize a number of damage dice equal to twice the number of arcane charges spent. 

In addition, your accumulated arcane energy protects you. Whenever you make a saving throw, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to your current number of arcane charges.

### Fire
Fire mages ignite enemies with balls of fire and combustive flames, harnessing the unrivaled destructive power of fire to utterly destroy their enemies.

#### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this specialization at 2nd level, you gain the *control flames* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of mage cantrips you know.

<div style='margin-top:530px;'></div>

#### Pyromaniac
Also at 2nd level, you learn how to enhance the volatile power of your fiery magic. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage, the spell's fire damage dice increase in size by one step; d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, and d10 to d12. If a spell already deals its damage in d12 dice, they don't increase any further.

#### Critical Mass
Beginning at 6th level, when a creature rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw made against a spell you cast that deals damage, they take double damage from the spell.

#### Cauterize
At 10th level, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to draw on the fiery energy that burns within you. You are instead reduced to 1 hit point, and each creature within 10 feet of you takes fire damage equal to half your mage level + your Intelligence modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Hot Streak
When you reach 14th level, you learn how to unleash the true destructive potential of your fire magic. When you roll fire damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, roll those dice and add those rolls to the damage. You may only reroll each die once with this feature.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:530px;'></div>

### Frost
Frost mages freeze enemies in their tracks and shatter them with icy magic, aided by summoned elementals or conjured wards.

#### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this specialization at 2nd level, you gain the *shape water* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of mage cantrips you know.

#### Frost Adept
Also at 2nd level, you learn to manifest your icy magic in an especially potent form. Choose one of the following features.

***Conjure Ice Barrier.*** When you cast an spell of 1st level or higher that deals frost damage, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create an ice barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The barrier has hit points equal to twice your mage level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the ice barrier has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast spell of 1st level or higher that deals cold damage, the barrier regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

Once you create the ice barrier, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.

\pagebreakNum

&emsp;***Summon Water Elemental.*** You can use your action and spend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to summon a water elemental to your service. See the creature's game statistics in the summoned water elemental stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, the summoned water elemental acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the elemental can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If your elemental drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action, its form disperses. You can only have one summoned water elemental at a time; summoning a new one causes an existing elemental to immediately disperse.

#### Bone Chilling
Beginning at 6th level, you can freeze your enemies with the icy magic of your spells. Whenever you deal cold damage to a creature with a spell attack, or a creature fails the saving throw of a spell you cast that deals cold damage, that target is *chilled* until the end of your next turn: its speed is halved, and it can't take reactions. Only your spells of 1st level or higher can chill creatures.

In addition, whenever a creature you have chilled takes cold damage from one of your spells, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage (minimum 1).

#### Frost Mastery
When you reach 10th level, your signature manifestation of frost magic become even more potent. You gain one of the following features, depending on your choice at 2nd level.

***Conjure Ice Barrier: Icicles.*** You can harness the lingering icy magic of your spells to unleash on your enemies. Whenever you cast spell of 1st level or higher that deals cold damage, instead of restoring hit points to your ice barrier, you can use your bonus action to make a spell attack roll against a creature you can see within 60 feet. On a hit, the creature takes cold damage equal to 1d6 + twice the level of the spell.

***Summon Water Elemental: Unbound Elemental.*** Your summoned water elemental gains the following benefits:

- Any creature hit by its Slam attack is grappled, with an escape DC equal to your spell save DC. The elemental can only grapple one creature at a time.
- Creatures hit by its waterbolt are pushed up to 10 feet away from the elemental in a straight line.
- When it uses its Freeze action, creatures that fail their saving throw take cold damage equal to 2d6 + your proficiency bonus, and are restrained until the end of the elemental's next turn. Creatures that succeed on their save take half damage and suffer no other effects.

#### Frigid Winds
At 14th level, your magical attacks against frozen foes become far deadlier. Your spell attack rolls have advantage against creatures you have chilled, and such creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells.

## Paladin
This is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead. Paladins are not only zealots, but also guardians of the righteous, and they bestow blessings on those the Light would shine upon. The Light radiates from paladins, and worthy allies who stand near them are emboldened by its power.

## Class Features
As a paladin, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per paladin level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** All armor, shields
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None

___
- **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
- **Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- *(a)* a martial weapon and a shield or *(b)* two martial weapons
- *(a)* five javelins or *(b)* any simple melee weapon
- *(a)* a priest's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
- Chain mail and a holy symbol

</div>

### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the dreadlord Mal'Ganis, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.

\columnbreak

&emsp;As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

\pagebreakNum

> ##### Additional Fighting Styles
> If you own *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, you can ask your DM if you can take the optional paladin fighting styles detailed within, in addition to the fighting styles listed here.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Protection
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

#### Versatile Weapon Fighting
When you are wielding a single versatile weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to AC if you are wielding that weapon with two hands.

### Spellcasting
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on holy magic through prayer and study to cast paladin spells. See chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting, and chapter 5 for the paladin spell list and new spells.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your libram. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your faith. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

 </font>
 
  <div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

### Crusader Strike
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.

### Divine Health
By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

### Paladin Specialization
When you reach 3rd level, you commit to the path that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you pledge yourself to the ideal of Holy, Protection, or Retribution.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

#### Specialization Spells
Each specialization has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. They are automatically added to your libram, and you always have them prepared. Specialization spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain a specialization spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

#### Channel Divinity
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

\pagebreakNum

&emsp;When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Aura of Protection
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Aura of Courage
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Improved Crusader Strike
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

### Cleansing Touch
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Aura Improvements
At 18th level, the range of your auras increase to 30 feet.

## Paladin Specializations
While all paladins follow the Light, they do so in different ways. Some paladins embrace the nurturing, healing nature of the Light, while others adopt its searing, wrathful aspect. The specialization you choose reflects your approach.

### Holy
Holy paladins invoke the power of the Light to protect and heal their allies.

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

***Bestow Faith.*** As a bonus action, you can bless a creature you can see within 60 feet with a fortifying boon, using your Channel Divinity. Until the beginning of your next turn, that creature has advantage on saving throws. At the beginning of your next turn, the creature is healed to half its hit point maximum if it has less than that amount. Undead or constructs cannot regain hit points from this feature

***Light of Dawn.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to radiate light that banishes darkness and heals injured allies. Magical darkness is dispelled in a 30-foot cone in front of you, and allies within that area regain hit points equal to 2d6 + your paladin level, up to half of their hit point maximum. Undead or constructs cannot regain hit points from this feature.

#### Holy Specialization Spells

#### Lightbringer
By 7th level, you have learned to use your natural healing abilities more effectively, especially in combat. You gain the following benefits:

- You can use your Lay on Hands ability on creatures you can see within 30 feet of you.
- When you use Lay on Hands to restore hit points to a creature, it regains hit points equal to twice the number of points expended.
- When you use your action to use Lay on Hands, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

#### Divine Purpose
Starting at 15th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell or paladin class feature (such as your Light of Dawn Channel Divinity), you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

#### Avenging Crusader
At 20th level, as an action, you can transform into an avatar of radiance. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Any magical darkness in the area of bright light is dispelled when you activate this feature. You also gain the following benefits:

- At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.
- Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.
- Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

### Protection
Protection paladins use holy magic to shield themselves and defend their allies, serving as stalwart champions against the forces of darkness.

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

***Aegis of Light.*** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to create a protective barrier of Light that shields your allies from harm. Until the beginning of your next turn, you and your allies within 10 feet have resistance to all damage.

***Judgment.*** As an action, you can channel holy power to smite a foe, using your Channel Divinity. Make a melee attack with your weapon against a creature you can see within 60 feet. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects plus extra radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your paladin level, and the creature deals only half damage with weapon attacks until the beginning of your next turn.

#### Protection Specialization Spells
| Paladin Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;*compelled duel*, *protection from evil <br>&ensp;and good* |
| 5th | &ensp;*enhance ability*, *warding bond* |

| 13th | &ensp;✦ *guardian of ancient kings*, *guardian <br>&ensp;of faith* |
| 17th | &ensp;*circle of power*, *dispel evil and good* |
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Righteous Fury
By 7th level, your holy might sears your foes. Whenever you deal radiant damage to a creature with an attack, or a creature fails the saving throw of a spell you cast that deals radiant damage, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you until the start of your next turn.

#### Holy Shield
Starting at 15th level, whenever a creature makes a melee attack against you and misses, they take radiant damage equal to 1d8 plus half your paladin level.

#### Avenging Guardian
At 20th level, as an action, you can transform into an avatar of protection. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Any magical darkness in the area of bright light is dispelled when you activate this feature. You also gain the following benefits:

- Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.
- Whenever an allied creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature gains 10 temporary hit points.
- You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, as do your allies within 30 feet of you.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

\pagebreakNum

### Retribution
Retribution paladins are righteous crusaders who judge and punish opponents with weapons and Holy magic.

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

***Divine Storm.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to lash out in holy fury with a melee weapon. Each creature you choose within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage as if it were hit by your weapon, plus an extra 2d8 radiant damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

***Shield of Vengeance.*** When you are damaged by a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to retaliate with holy fire, using your Channel Divinity. You gain resistance to the triggering attack's damage, and the creature that damaged you must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your paladin level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Retribution Specialization Spells
| Paladin Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;*divine favor*, *searing smite* |

<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

\columnbreak

#### Zeal
By 7th level, your strikes are so powerful that they cleave to nearby foes. Once on each of your turns when you make a melee weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

In addition, when you cast a specialization spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 round for that casting, ending at the end of your next turn (or earlier, if the spell specifies).

#### Eye for an Eye
Starting at 15th level, when an enemy creature within your melee range makes a successful attack against you or an ally, you may use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against them.

#### Avenging Wrath
At 20th level, as an action, you can transform into an avatar of retribution. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Any magical darkness in the area of bright light is dispelled when you activate this feature. You also gain the following benefits:

- Radiant wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
- Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Priest
Priests are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. For millennia they have left behind the confines of their temples and the comfort of their shrines so they can support their allies in war-torn lands. In the midst of terrible conflict, no hero questions the value of the priestly orders. These masters of the healing arts keep their companions fighting far beyond their normal capacities with an array of restorative powers and blessings. The divine forces at the priest's command can also be turned against foes, smiting them with holy fury. As light cannot exist without darkness, and darkness without light, some priests tap into shadow to better understand their own abilities, as well as the abilities of those who threaten them.

## Class Features
As a priest, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per priest level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per priest level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** None
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons
- **Tools:** None

___
- **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
- **Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- *(a)* a mace or *(b)* any simple weapon
- *(a)* a priest's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
- A holy symbol

### Spellcasting
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast priest spells. See chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting, and chapter 5 for the priest spell list and new spells.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the priest spell list. You learn additional priest cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Priest table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your priest spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of priest spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest spell list. When you do so, choose a number of priest spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your priest level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level priest, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your priest spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your faith, devotion, and will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a priest spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a priest spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your priest spells.

### Light and Shadow
All priests can channel the powers of light and darkness, though the specifics differ by tradition and belief. You know the spells *bless* and *bane*. You always have these spells prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

In addition, you can cast one of these spells once without expending a spell slot and without requiring concentration. You must then finish a short or long rest to do so again.

### Enlightenment
At 2nd level, your devotion has unlocked a deep wellspring of power within yourself. This wellspring is represented by faith points, which allow you to create a variety of potent effects.

\columnbreak

#### Faith Points
You have 2 faith points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Faith Points column of the Priest table. You can never have more faith points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent faith points when you finish a long rest.

#### Flexible Casting
You can use your faith points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional faith points. You learn other ways to use your faith points as you reach higher levels.

***Creating Spell Slots.*** You can transform unexpended faith points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.

***Converting a Spell Slot to Faith Points.*** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of faith points equal to the slot's level.

#### Creating Spell Slots
| Spell Slot Level | &nbsp;&nbsp;Faith Point Cost |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | &nbsp;&nbsp;2 |
| 2nd | &nbsp;&nbsp;3 |
| 3rd | &nbsp;&nbsp;5 |
| 4th | &nbsp;&nbsp;6 |

\pagebreakNum

### Priest Specialization
Also at 2nd level, you choose a priest specialization. Your specialization describes how you manifest your spiritual power: Discipline, Holy, or Shadow, all of which are detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you specialization spells and other features when you choose it at 2nd level, and additional features at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

#### Specialization Spells
Each specialization has a list of spells---its specialization spells---that you gain at the priest levels noted in the specialization description. Once you gain a specialization spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a specialization spell that doesn't appear on the priest spell list, the spell is nonetheless a priest spell for you.

### Words of Power
At 3rd level, you learn to pronounce magical words of great power, granted to you by whatever faith, philosophy, or patron you follow. You gain three of the following Words of Power options of your choice. You gain another one at 6th, 10th, and 17th level. You can use only one Word of Power each turn.

#### Holy Word: Chastise
As a bonus action, you can spend 2 faith points to chastise a creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is incapacitated until the end of your next turn.

#### Holy Word: Sanctify
When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you can spend 3 faith points and instead use the highest number possible for each die.

#### Holy Word: Serenity
When a creature you can see within 60 feet fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can expend 1 faith point and use your reaction to make the creature succeed instead.

#### Power Word: Barrier
When a creature within 60 feet makes a saving throw, you may use your reaction and spend 3 faith points to allow that creature to reroll the saving throw. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM declares whether the saving throw succeeds or fails.

#### Power Word: Fortitude
As a bonus action, you may spend 2 faith points and grant a creature you can see within 60 feet temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your priest level.

#### Power Word: Shield
When a creature you can see within 60 feet is hit by an attack, you may use your reaction and spend 1 faith point to add your proficiency bonus to their AC until the start of their next turn, including against the triggering attack.

\columnbreak

#### Shadow Word: Death
When a creature within 60 feet of you takes damage from an attack or spell, you can spend 2 faith points and use your reaction to deal necrotic damage to it equal to 1d10 + your priest level. If this damage doesn't reduce the creature to 0 hit points, you take half this damage, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

#### Shadow Word: Pain
You can spend 1 faith point when you cast a spell on a creature to inflict torment, provided the spell hit the target with an attack or it failed a saving throw against the spell. At the beginning of the target's next turn, it takes a number of d4s of necrotic damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

#### Shadow Word: Void
When you deal psychic or necrotic damage to a creature with a spell, you can spend 3 faith points to cripple its resolve. That creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Divine Restoration
At 20th level, you regain 4 expended faith points whenever you finish a short rest.

## Priest Specializations
Priests in Azeroth serve all manner of religions and patrons, from the Holy Light to the endless Void. While all are united by faith in a higher power, they manifest that faith in different ways. The specialization you choose reflects your approach.

### Discipline
Discipline priests use magic to shield allies as well as heal their wounds, while punishing their enemies with spells. 

#### Discipline Specialization Spells
| Priest Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;*hold person*, *silence* |
| 5th | &ensp;*beacon of hope*, *dispel magic* |

<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Atonement
Starting at 2nd level, you heal your allies even as you punish your foes. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage, you can choose another creature you can see within 60 feet of you to regain hit points equal to 1d6 + half your priest level. You can't use this feature to restore hit points to an undead or a construct.

<div style='margin-top:540px;'></div>

#### Confessor
Also at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight skill. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.

#### Rapture
At 6th level, you can use your bonus action to empower yourself with righteous conviction. For 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated or die, your Words of Power have their faith point cost reduced by 1. 

You can use this feature once at 6th level, and twice at 14th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Contrition
When you reach 14th level, when you use a Power Word on a creature, your Atonement healing to that creature is doubled until the end of your next turn.

#### Pain Supression
At 18th level, you may use your action to safeguard a creature you can see within 60 feet against harm and other ill effects. For 1 minute, the creature gains resistance to all damage, and has advantage on all saving throws.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:540px;'></div>

### Holy
Holy priests are the foremost practitioners of the healing arts, who use their divine power to bless allies and mend wounds. Yet these holy champions are also capable of smiting foes and carrying out sacred justice with radiant might.

#### Holy Specialization Spells
| Priest Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;✦ *holy fire*, *lesser restoration* |
| 5th | &ensp;*beacon of hope*, *revivify* |
| 7th | &ensp;*death ward*, *guardian of faith* |
| 9th | &ensp;*mass cure wounds*, *raise dead* |
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Disciple of Life
Starting at 2nd level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

#### Miracle Worker
Also at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill. In addition, whenever you successfully stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains 1 hit point.

\pagebreakNum

#### Circle of Healing
At 6th level, you learn how to radiate holy energy to heal the badly injured. As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your priest level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

You can use this feature once at 6th level, and twice at 14th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Echo of Light
When you reach 14th level, you are able to draw even more power from your Holy Words. After you invoke a Holy Word, the next spell you cast of 1st level or higher before the end of your next turn is cast one spell level higher, to a maximum of 9th level.

#### Guardian Spirit
At 18th level, you can call upon the spirits to guide a fallen ally back to their body. When a creature you can see within 60 feet would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, or would be subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, you can use your reaction to prevent that damage or effect. If the creature was below half their hit point maximum, they are healed to that value. Finally, the creature is immune to all damage until the start of their next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Shadow
Shadow priests use dark arts to eradicate their enemies, harnessing the baleful magic of the Void, the Shadowlands, and other forbidden sources of power.

#### Shadow Specialization Spells
| Priest Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;✦ *mind blast*, *phantasmal force* |
| 5th | &ensp;✦ *mind sear*, *vampiric touch* |
| 7th | &ensp;*Evard's black tentacles*, *phantasmal killer* |
| 9th | &ensp;*contact other plane*, *dominate person* |
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Twist of Fate
Starting at 2nd level, your damaging cantrips that deal psychic or necrotic damage affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

\columnbreak

#### Master Manipulator
Also at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Deception skill. You have advantage on all checks and rolls to conceal your motives, emotions, or thoughts, such as when you roll Charisma (Deception) to oppose a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check against you, or when you make a Wisdom saving throw to resist the full effect of a *detect thoughts* spell.

#### Shadowform
At 6th level, you may use your bonus action to wreathe yourself in shadowy energy. For 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated or die, you enjoy the following benefits:

- You can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of any priest spell you cast that deals necrotic or psychic damage.
- You can cast damaging priest spells with a range of touch and make melee spell attacks against targets you can see within 60 feet.
- You are considered to be behind half cover, as swirling shadows protect you.

You can use this feature once at 6th level, and twice at 14th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Shadowy Apparitions
When you reach 14th level, you are able to conjure shadowy visions of yourself that can distract and hinder your enemies. Whenever you spend faith points to invoke a Shadow Word, a dark illusion appears around you. These apparitions last for 1 minute or until they are destroyed, and you can have at most three of them present at once. While any apparitions are present, you are considered to be under the effects of a *mirror image* spell, with the number of images equal to the number of apparitions.

In addition to their defensive benefit, you may also use your bonus action to command an apparition to assault a foe. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within 60 feet. On a success, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + half your priest level. Regardless of whether the attack hits or misses, the apparition is destroyed.

#### Vampiric Embrace
At 18th level, you learn how to use your spells to steal the life from your enemies to restore your allies. You use your bonus action to activate this Vampiric Embrace, which lasts for 1 minute. You can use the same bonus action to activate both this feature and your Shadowform.

While using Vampiric Embrace, when you use a spell of 1st level or higher to deal damage to a creature on your turn, you may choose another creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to the half the damage taken by the original creature. If your spell affects multiple creatures at once, you choose which target is used to determine the amount of healing.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Rogue
For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and vanishing into the shadows before the victim hits the ground. With the rogue's cunning, speed, and lethality, the first strike is often the last step before the killing blow.

</div>

### Expertise
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.

### Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

\columnbreak

&emsp;The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the rogue table.

### Thieves' Cant
During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### Cunning Action
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Rogue Specialization
At 3rd level, you choose a specialization that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Assassination, Outlaw, or Survival, all of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your specialization choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

### Dirty Tricks
At 6th level, you learn how to weaken your foes with debilitating attacks. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can force the target to make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. On a failure, the creature is blinded, incapacitated, or its speed is reduced to 0 (your choice), until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. You can use this feature twice between rests starting at 10th level and three times between rests starting at 14th level.

\pagebreakNum

### Evasion
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Vigor
At 10th level, you gain an additional bonus action you can use on your turn. You can use this bonus action only for your Cunning Action feature, and can't use both bonus actions to take the same action twice on the same turn.

### Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Rogue Specialiations
Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue specializations. Your choice of specialization is a reflection of your focus — not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

### Assassination
Assassination rogues are deadly masters of poisons who dispatch their victims with vicious strikes.

\columnbreak

> ##### Acknowledgment
> This assassination rogue was inspired by SargeBriar's [Tweaked Assassin](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GFrUnq6MADWbPjquvlumKdAx__83rQSt/view) rogue archetype.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

#### Deadly Poisons
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the poisoner's kit.

In addition, as a bonus action you can apply a dose of deadly poison to your weapon or a piece of ammunition, which lasts for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. The poison ignores immunity to the poisoned condition, and its save DC is calculated as follows:

 <font face='scalysans' size='2'>
 
 <center> 
 
 **Poison save DC** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
 
 </center>
 
 <div style='margin-top:-8px'></div>
 
 <center> your Intelligence modifier </center>
 
 </font>
 
<div style='margin-top:8px'></div>

When you use this feature, choose one of the following:

***Agonizing poison (injury).*** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is unable to take reactions. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Crippling poison (injury).*** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature's speed is halved. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Wound poison (injury).*** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. When the poisoned create makes a successful weapon attack and rolls damage, it must roll twice and use the lower result. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. A creature can only be affected by one of your deadly poisons at a time.

#### Ambush
Also at 3rd level, you have advantage on initiative rolls. You also have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet.

#### Master Poisoner
At 9th level, your deadly poisons are enhanced in the following ways:

- When a creature successfully saves against your poison, the poison doesn't end but is inactive until the end of the creature's next turn, when it can make another saving throw as normal. The poison ends when the creature has made three successful saves against it.
- When a creature fails a saving throw against one of your Deadly Poisons, it takes 2d8 poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful save, which ignores resistance and immunity to poison damage. This damage increases to 3d8 at 17th level.

In addition, you can choose to use your poison save DC for any poison you use, not just your Deadly Poisons.

\pagebreakNum

#### Prey on the Weak
At 13th level, you are at your deadliest when your enemies are at their weakest. When you make a successful weapon attack against a creature that currently has disadvantage on all attack rolls (for example, from being blinded or poisoned) or cannot take actions (for example, from being incapacitated), your attack deals an additional 1d6 damage.

#### Envenom
When you reach 17th level, you learn to deal a devastating surprise attack against a chosen foe, crippling their resistances. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your poison save DC. A surprised creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. On a failure, the damage dealt to it by the attack is doubled and it fails any saving throws against poison until the end of the turn. This effect occurs before any poisons applied with this attack.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Outlaw
Outlaw rogues are daring swashbucklers who use agility and guile to stand toe-to-toe with their enemies.

#### Hit and Run
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn. 

#### Blade Flurry
Also at 3rd level, you can trade lethal precision for daring agility. When you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn. In addition, if you hit and would inflict Sneak Attack damage, you can forgo half your Sneak Attack damage dice to make an additional weapon attack as part of the same action. If this attack hits, it deals additional damage dice equal to half your Sneak Attack damage dice.

At 13th level, when you use Blade Flurry you can make two additional weapon attacks as part of the same action, each of which deals additional damage dice equal to half your Sneak Attack damage dice.

#### Quick Draw
Starting at 9th level, you can draw a weapon as part of an attack you make with it.

In addition, once on your turn when you miss with a weapon attack, you can immediately make another attack with a different light weapon as part of the same action.

#### Parry & Riposte
By 13th level, you have become a master duelist. When you are hit by a weapon attack but before damage is rolled, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC. If this causes the attack to miss you, you can immediately make one weapon attack against your attacker as part of the same reaction, if they are within range of your weapon.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

\pagebreakNum

#### Killing Spree
When you reach 17th level, you can unleash a devastating whirlwind of strikes against your enemies. You can use your action to make a melee weapon attack against any number of creatures you can see within 20 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. Each successful attack automatically deals Sneak Attack damage. You can then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets you attacked. Using Killing Spree counts as dealing your Sneak Attack damage for this turn

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Subtlety
Subtlety rogues are dark stalkers who harness the power of shadows to ambush unsuspecting prey.

#### Subterfuge
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the forgery kit. Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.

#### Shadow Magic
Also at 3rd level, you gain the *minor illusion* cantrip if you don't already know it. You can also cast more potent spells using shadow points. See chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for spells cast using this feature.

You have a number of shadow points equal to your rogue level divided by 3, rounded up. You must spend a number of shadow points equal to the spell's level to cast it. When you spend a shadow point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended shadow points.

You are initially able to cast the spells *fog cloud* and *silent image*. At higher levels, you learn to cast additional spells, as shown in the Shadow Magic Spells table.

\columnbreak

#### Shadow Magic Spells
| Rogue Level | &nbsp;&nbsp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &nbsp;&nbsp;*fog cloud*, *silent image* |
| 7th | &nbsp;&nbsp;*invisibility*, *misty step* |
| 13th | &nbsp;&nbsp;*blink*, *major image* |
| 19th | &nbsp;&nbsp;*dimension door*, *greater invisibility* |

#### Nightstalker
Starting at 9th level, you are more adept at striking from the shadows. When you make an attack with advantage and the attack hits, it deals an additional 1d6 damage.

#### Shadow Focus
At 13th level, you can cast your Shadow Magic spells as a bonus action. These spells are also enhanced in the following ways:

- You ignore the obscurement created by your *fog cloud*.
- When you cast *silent image* or *major image*, as a bonus action you can change the nature of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.
- Your *invisibility* and *greater invisibility* spells also make you imperceptible to blindsight and tremorsense, in addition to normal sight.
- When you cast *misty step* or *dimension door*, you can immediately turn invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw.
- While using *blink*, if the result of your d20 roll is 10 or lower, you have half cover until the start of your next turn.

#### Secret Technique
When you reach 17th level, you learn to conjure illusory doubles to strike at your foes. Immediately after you deal your Sneak Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can use your bonus action to target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Make an attack roll with the same weapon against this creature; if the attack succeeds, it deals psychic damage equal to your Sneak Attack damage instead of the attack's normal damage.

## Shaman
Shamans are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike some other mystics, shamans commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire, water, and air, shamans summon totems that focus the elements to support the shaman's allies or punish those who threaten them.

</div>

### Kalimag
You can speak, read, and write Kalimag, the sacred language of elementals. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with elementals, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

### Spellcasting
As a conduit for elemental power, you can cast shaman spells. See chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting, and chapter 5 for the shaman spell list and new spells.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the shaman spell list. You learn additional shaman cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Shaman table.

\columnbreak

#### Spell Slots
The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your shaman spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the shaman spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Shaman table shows when you learn more shaman spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the shaman spells you know and replace it with another spell from the shaman spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

\pagebreakNum

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells. Your magic comes from your devotion to the elements. You use your Wisdom whenever a shaman spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

 <font face='scalysans' size='2'>

 </font>
 
 <div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a shaman spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a shamanic totem as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells.

### Elemental Attunement
Also at 1st level, you can align your spirit with one of the elements. Choose one of the elemental attunements listed below. You can change your attuned element whenever you finish a long rest.

***Air.*** When you make a Dexterity check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. You also gain a bonus to your AC against ranged weapon attacks equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

***Earth.*** When you make a Strength check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. While you aren't wearing heavy armor, you also subtract your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) from any bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take.

***Fire.*** When you make a Charisma check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. You also gain a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

***Water.*** When you make a Wisdom check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. You also subtract your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) from any acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage that you take.

### Totemist
Beginning at 2nd level, you can summon an totem which channels the power of the elements. Using a shamanic totem, you can take an action to magically summon a Small elemental totem in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 30 feet of you.

Once you summon a totem, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Beginning at 7th level, you can use your Totemist feature twice between rests, and beginning at 15th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. You can have only one elemental totem summoned at a time; an existing totem is destroyed if you use this feature again to summon a new one.

\columnbreak

&emsp;The totem is a magical object. It has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your shaman level. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 minute. You can dismiss it early as an action.

You choose whether to summon a totem of air, earth, fire, or water. At the end of your turn, you can choose to use one of the element's listed totem powers. Totem powers use your shaman spell attack modifier and spell save DC, and have a range of 30 feet. Totem powers that involve rolling 1d4 roll additional dice as you gain shaman levels: 2d4 at 5th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 17th level.

#### Air Totem Powers
Totems of air can strike enemies with crackling lightning and heighten the agility of your allies.

***Stormlash.*** Make a ranged spell attack roll against a creature you can see within the totem's range. On a hit, the target takes lightning damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Windwalk.*** Choose a number of creatures you can see within the totem's range, up to your proficiency bonus. Each creature adds 10 feet to its movement speed, and its movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, until the end of its next turn.

#### Earth Totem Powers
Totems of earth can incapacitate enemies with grasping vines and grant allies great resilience.

***Earthgrab.*** Choose a creature you can see within the totem's range, which must be within 5 feet of the ground. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the vines until the end of your next turn.

***Stone Bulwark.*** Choose a number of creatures you can see within the totem's range, up to your proficiency bonus. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier.

\pagebreakNum

#### Fire Totem Powers
Totems of fire can bless your allies' weapons with searing flame, or radiate blazing heat to burn your enemies.

***Fire Nova.*** Choose a number of creatures you can see within the totem's range, up to your proficiency bonus. Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save a target takes 1d4 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Flametongue.*** Choose a creature you can see within the totem's range. The next successful weapon attack that creature makes, until the end of its next turn, deals additional fire damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier.

#### Water Totem Powers
Totems of water can restore the vitality of your allies or freeze your enemies with chilling ice.

***Healing Stream.*** A creature you can see within the totem's range to regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier. This power can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum, and has no effect on undead or constructs.

***Icechill.*** Choose a number of creatures you can see within the totem's range, up to your proficiency bonus. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 cold damage, and have its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.

### Shaman Specialization
At 3rd level, you choose a specialization which focuses your growing mastery over the elements. Choose Elemental, Enhancement, or Restoration, all detailed at the end of the class description. The specialization you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

#### Specialization Spells
Each specialization has a list of spells---its specialization spells---that you gain at the shaman levels noted in the specialization description. These spells count as shaman spells for you, but don't count against the number of shaman spells you know. These spells can't be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Totem Mastery
Beginning at 10th level, you gain the following benefits:

- The range at which you can summon your totem, and the range of totem powers, increases to 60 feet.
- You can use a bonus action to move your totem to an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 60 feet of you.
- You can cast spells as though you were in your totem's space, though you still use your own senses.

\columnbreak

### Elemental Ascension
When you reach 20th level, you can assume the form of a mighty elemental avatar. You can use your action to cast *investiture of flame*, *investiture of ice*, *investiture of stone*, or *investiture of wind* (found in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*) without expending a spell slot and without requiring concentration. While using this feature, you can use the *investiture*'s special action once on your turn for free, without using an action. In addition, when you cast a spell using a spell slot it is cast one spell level higher, to a maximum of 9th level.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Shaman Specializations
While all shaman harness the power of the elements to use their abilities, different shaman do so in different ways. The specialization you choose reflects your approach.

### Elemental
The primal magic of elemental shaman can be used to damage enemies from afar with lightning strikes, earthquakes, and lava bursts.

#### Elemental Specialization Spells
| Shaman Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;*flaming sphere*, *maximilian's <br>&ensp;earthen grasp* |
| 5th | &ensp;*erupting earth*, *lightning bolt* |
| 7th | &ensp;✦ *thunderstorm*, *wall of fire* |
| 9th | &ensp;*conjure elemental*, *control winds* |
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you learn one additional shaman cantrip of your choice.

#### Primal Recovery
Also at 3rd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with the elemental spirits. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your shaman level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level shaman, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

#### Echo of the Elements
Beginning at 6th level, your spells surge with reverberating power. When you roll damage for a shaman spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, roll those dice again and add those rolls to the damage. You may only reroll each die once with this feature.

#### Primal Elementalist
When you reach 14th level, by force or friendship, you have earned the loyalty of powerful elemental spirits. Any elemental summoned or created by a spell that you cast gains the following benefits while under your control:

- Its hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your shaman level.
- When it makes an attack, you can replace its natural attack modifier with your spell attack modifier.
- It adds half your proficiency bonus to its damage rolls.
- The damage from its attacks is considered magical.

In addition, whenever you start casting such a spell, you can modify it so that its cast time becomes 1 action and it doesn't require concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.

#### Elemental Overload
At 18th level, when you cast a spell, you can choose to overload yourself with elemental might. During this turn, you have advantage on any spell attack rolls made for the spell, any saving throws made against the spell have disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage. After using this feature, you can't cast spells until the end of your next turn.

Once you use Elemental Overload, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Enhancement
Enhancement shaman call on the spirits to aid them in battle directly, enhancing their blows with elemental power.

#### Enhancement Specialization Spells
| Shaman Level | &ensp;Spells |

| 5th | &ensp;*blur*, *enhance ability* |
| 9th | &ensp;*haste*, ✦ *spirit beast* |
| 13th | &ensp;*fire shield*, *stoneskin* |
| 17th | &ensp;*destructive wave*, ✦ *sundering* |
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Totem Warrior
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. When wielding a weapon you are proficient with, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells.

In addition, you may use your Wisdom modifier instead of Dexterity for the purposes of determining your AC. You still must respect the limitations, conditions, and restrictions of any armor you wear. In particular, if your armor limits the maximum Dexterity modifier you may apply to your AC, that limitation also applies to your Wisdom modifier.

Finally, you refer to the Enhancement Spellasting table to determine your spells known and spell slots gained whenever you gain a level in this class. You may prepare a number of shaman spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your shaman level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). You otherwise follow the rules for shaman spellcasting as described earlier in the class description.

#### Fighting Style
Also at 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

***Defense.*** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

***Dueling.*** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

***Great Weapon Fighting.*** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

***Two-Weapon Fighting.*** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

***Versatile Weapon Fighting.*** When you are wielding a single versatile weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to AC if you are wielding that weapon with two hands.

\columnbreak

> ##### Variant Rule: Light Maces
> To give dual-wielding enhancement shaman more weapon variety, dungeon masters might consider giving maces the Light weapon property.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

#### Bonus Cantrips
Finally at 3rd level, you learn one of the following cantrips: *acid-bite blade*, *booming blade*, *chilling blade*, or *green-flame blade*. These cantrips don't count against your number of cantrips known. You gain another cantrip from this list at 7th, 11th, and 15th level, or another shaman cantrip of your choice if you've already learned all four.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

> ##### Enhancement Weapon Strikes
> Many enhancement shaman call their weapon attack cantrips by different names. For example,
> * *Acid-bite blade* is called *rockbiter*;
> * *Booming blade* is called *stormstrike*;
> * *Chilling blade* is called *frostbrand*;
> * *Green-flame blade* is called *lava lash*.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

#### Windfury
Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

In addition, when you take the Attack action you may replace one of the attacks with casting a shaman cantrip.

#### Enhanced Elements
When you reach 14th level, your relationship with the elements is strengthened. When you finish a long rest you can choose two Elemental Attunement options.

In addition, whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage of type acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder (your choice).

#### Stormkeeper
Beginning at 18th level, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you may replace one of the attacks with casting a shaman spell that has a casting time of 1 action. You may only replace at most one attack on your turn with a spell using this ability or Windfury.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

> ##### Nature Damage?
> In *World of Warcraft*, the element of earth is often associated with Nature damage. Since this damage type does not exist in D&D 5E, acid damage is sometimes used to represent pure earth-aspected magic. 

\pagebreakNum

### Restoration
By calling on their spiritual power, restoration shaman can restore health to injured allies.

#### Restoration Specialization Spells
| Shaman Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;*calm emotions*, ✦ *wellspring* |
| 5th | &ensp;*aura of vitality*, ✦ *chain heal* |
| 7th | &ensp;*aura of purity*, *control water* |
| 9th | &ensp;*maelstrom*, ✦ *tranquil rain* |
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Deep Healing
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you learn how to call upon the elements for aid when your allies are near death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

In addition, you learn the *spare the dying* cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of shaman cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.

#### Elemental Aegis
Also at 3rd level, you can invoke the elements to safeguard your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6 plus half your shaman level. In addition, you can choose to apply one of the following elemental effects:

***Air Shield.*** If you used this reaction in response to a melee attack, the attacker must make a successful Strength saving throw or be pushed straight backwards 15 feet

***Earth Shield.*** The defended creature regains hit points equal to the amount by which you reduced the damage.

***Fire Shield.*** If you used this reaction in response to a melee attack, the attacker must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to the amount by which you reduced the damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

\columnbreak

&emsp;***Water Shield.*** The defended creature has advantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Deluge
Beginning at 6th level, whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to more than one creature, all affected creatures regain additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

#### Spirit Tide
At 14th level, you can replenish the spirits of nearby allies with a swell of restorative energy. As an action, choose a number of creatures within 60 feet that you can see, up to your proficiency bonus. For each target, roll 1d4 and choose one of the following effects:

- The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals their number rolled or lower (the creature's choice).
- The creature regains hit points equal to your proficiency bonus, and can choose to spend hit dice to regain hit points as if they completed a short rest. It can spend a number of hit dice up to the number you rolled (the creature's choice). 

You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to use it again when you finish a long rest.

#### Resurging Elements
When you reach 18th level, you can extend the protective elemental energy you invoke to safeguard your allies. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a use of Elemental Aegis and ward a creature you can see within 60 feet. For 1 minute, you can use your reaction to defend the warded target with your Elemental Aegis feature without expending its uses. You can only ward one creature at a time with this feature, but can continue to use Elemental Aegis to defend other creatures, expending uses as normal. You can use Resurging Elements again to ward a new creature, ending the ward on the previous target.

## Warlock
In the face of demonic power, most heroes see death. Warlocks see only opportunity. Dominance is their aim, and they have found a path to it in the dark arts. These voracious spellcasters summon demonic minions to fight beside them. At first, they command only the service of imps, but as a warlock's knowledge grows, seductive succubi, loyal voidwalkers, and horrific felhunters join the dark sorcerer's ranks to wreak havoc on anyone who stands in their master's way. Warlocks can ignite distant enemies in searing flame, send them fleeing in terror and pain, or afflict them with corrupting diseases and curses that steal the victim's vitality.

</div>

### Eredun
You can speak, read, and write Eredun, the profane language of demons. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with demons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

### Pact Magic
Your research into fel magic and the oaths you've sworn to dark powers have given you facility with spells. See chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting, and chapter 5 for the warlock spell list and new spells.

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

\columnbreak

#### Spell Slots
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *witch bolt*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

\pagebreakNum

&emsp;Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

 <font face='scalysans' size='2'>
 
 <center> 
 
 **Spell save DC** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> 8 + your proficiency bonus +

 </font>
 
<div style='margin-top:12px'></div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast any warlock spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

\columnbreak

### Demon Summoning
You can summon demonic minions from the Twisting Nether, to aid you and do your bidding. Doing so requires you to perform a 10-minute ritual, at the end of which you summon a felhunter, imp, succubus, or voidwalker to serve as your minion. If you choose the demonology specialization at 2nd level, you can also summon a felguard minion. You can perform this ritual once and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest, unless you expend a warlock spell slot to do so again. The stat blocks for these creatures can be found in appendix C.

In combat, the summoned demon acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the demon can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. 

As an action, you can temporarily banish your minion. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can banish it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. If a summoned demonic minion drops to 0 hit points, it is immediately banished back to the Twisting Nether and must be resummoned.

You can only have one summoned demonic minion at a time; summoning a new one causes an existing minion to immediately be banished back to the Twisting Nether.

\pagebreakNum

#### Demonic Magic
After you summon a demonic minion, you temporarily learn a number of spells from the Demonic Magic feature in the minion's stat block. You learn all the spells that you can cast with your warlock spell slots. These spells count as warlock spells for you, but don't count against the number of warlock spells you know. You know these spells until you summon a new demonic minion, and learn its Demonic Magic spells. 

For example, if you are a 5th level warlock and summon an imp minion, you temporarily learn the spells *silent image*, *invisibility*, and *blink*. You do not learn the spells *confusion* or *mislead*, since they are too high level to cast with your warlock spell slots.

### Warlock Specialization
At 2nd level, you hone your study of profane magic towards a particular specialization. Choose Affliction, Demonology, or Destruction, all detailed at the end of the class description. The specialization you choose grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Demonic Pact
Beginning at 3rd level, you can enhance your demon summoning capabilities. Choose one of the following:

#### Pact of Supremacy
Your demonic minions add their proficiency bonus to their AC, and have an additional number of hit points equal to your warlock level.

#### Pact of Sacrifice
You may use your action to reduce your current demonic minion to 0 hit points, making a pact of sacrifice to gain some of its power. This pact gives you several benefits, and lasts until you finish a long rest or summon another demonic minion.

When you make a pact of sacrifice, your hit point maximum and current hit points increase by your warlock level. You also gain proficiency in the sacrificed demon's listed skills and saving throws. Finally, once per turn when you deal damage with a spell, you can add your proficiency bonus to one damage roll of that spell.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Soul Shards
At 5th level, you can harvest fragments of souls and capture them in magical gems known as soul shards. You may have a maximum of three soul shards, increasing to four soul shards at 9th level, and five soul shards at 15th level. You may expend your sould shards to may use to fuel the soul rites listed below.

\columnbreak

&emsp;You regain all expended soul shards when you finish a long rest. You may also use your reaction to regain a soul shard when a living creature within 60 feet dies, harvesting a portion of their soul before it passes to the Shadowlands. A creature must have a challenge rating of 1/4 or higher for their soul to be harvested in this way.

#### Soul Rites
You can spend soul shards on any of the following soul rites.

***Create Healthstone.*** As an action, you may expend a soul shard to create a healthstone, which you may keep or give away. As an action, anyone may crush a healthstone to regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your warlock level. The healthstone is destroyed after use, or when you finish a long rest.

***Create Soulstone.*** As an action, you may expend a soul shard to create a soulstone, which you may keep or give away. You may only have one soulstone in existence at a time; using this rite again immediately destroys the previous soulstone. When the bearer of your soulstone is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, they may drop to 1 hit point instead, and the soulstone is destroyed. If not used, the soulstone is destroyed when you finish a long rest.

***Nether Ward.*** When you roll a saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend a soul shard to reroll the saving throw. You can choose to use this rite after you make your initial roll, but before the DM declares whether the saving throw succeeds or fails.

***Soul Burn.*** You can spend a soul shard when you cast a warlock spell to make the spell ignore damage resistance and immunity.

***Soul Conduit.*** You can use a soul shard to cast a warlock spell you know without expending a spell slot. The spell must be of level at most half your proficiency bonus.

### Demonic Power
Beginning at 7th level, you can draw even more magical power from your demonic minions. You can cast a Demonic Magic spell once without expending a warlock spell slot, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

At 12th level, you can cast your current 1st level Demonic Magic spell at will, without expending a spell slot.

At 18th level, you can cast your current 2nd level Demonic Magic spell at will, without expending a spell slot.

### Fel Arcanum
At 11th level, your investigations into the darkest mysteries of the Twisting Nether have allowed you to discover a forbidden magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Fel Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

\pagebreakNum

### Dark Soul
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while calling on the terrible darkness of the Twisting Nether to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute performing a profane ritual to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

## Warlock Specializations
While all warlocks harness the fel energies of the Twisting Nether for their own purposes, they do so in different ways. The specialization you choose reflects how you pursue this terrible power, and what you wish to accomplish with it.

### Affliction
Affliction warlocks are masters of shadow magic who specialize in spells that sap the life and will of their enemies.

#### Expanded Spell List
As a specialist in affliction, you may choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Affliction Expanded Spells
| Warlock Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;*blindness/deafness*, ✦ *mind blast* |
| 5th | &ensp;*slow*, *vampiric touch* |
| 7th | &ensp;*blight*, *confusion* |
| 9th | &ensp;*antilife shell*, *contagion* |
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Corruption
When you adopt this specialization at 2nd level, you learn to corrupt the efforts of others with dark magic. You have a number of corruption dice equal to your Intelligence modifier, which are d6s. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend a corruption die, rolling the die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. Using this feature requires verbal and somatic components as if casting a spell.

A corruption die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended corruption dice when you finish a short or long rest. Your corruption dice change when you reach certain levels in this class. The dice become d8s at 6th level, d10s at 10th level, and d12s at 14th level.

#### Shadow Embrace
Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals necrotic or psychic damage, you can add your corruption die to one necrotic or psychic damage roll of that spell against one of its targets. This does not expend a corruption die.

In addition, you can cast warlock spells with a range of touch and make melee spell attacks against targets you can see within 60 feet.

\columnbreak

#### Siphon Life
At 10th level, you have learned how to draw strength from the misery of your foes. Whenever you use Corruption, you gain temporary hit points equal to the number rolled.

#### Endless Affliction
Starting at 14th level, whenever you use Corruption, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a corruption die. In addition, if you use Corruption on a creature and it dies before the end of your next turn, you can choose to regain an expended soul shard.

### Demonology
Demonology warlocks are masters of demons who compel fiendish powers to aid them. They use these powers to bolster the strength of their summoned demons, or even claim them for their own use.

#### Expanded Spell List
As a specialist in demonology, you may choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Demonology Expanded Spells
| Warlock Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;*enhance ability*, *warding bond* |
| 5th | &ensp;*crusader's mantle* (necrotic damage), <br>&ensp;*haste* |
| 7th | &ensp;*aura of purity*, *guardian of faith* <br>&ensp;(necrotic damage) |
| 9th | &ensp;*circle of power*, *planar binding* |

<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

#### Master Demonologist
When you adopt this specialization at 2nd level, your demonic magic become more powerful. You treat your proficiency bonus as if it was 2 higher for the purposes of determining your demon's statistics (and the bonus damage of Pact of Sacrifice, if you select that feature at 3rd level).

#### Soul Link
When you reach 6th level, you can share your pain with your demonic thralls. Whenever you take damage while within 60 feet of a demon you summoned with a warlock spell or class feature, you may choose to reduce the damage taken by half. Your demon immediately takes the same amount of damage, which can't be reduced in any way. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage.

#### Master Summoner
At 10th level, you learn the spell *summon greater demon*, which does not count against your number of spells known. You can cast it once at 5th level without expending a spell slot, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you cast a spell that summons a demon, you can modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting, and the demon automatically fails any saving throws made to resist your control.

\pagebreakNum

#### Fel Domination
Beginning at 14th level, when you use your Master Summoner feature to cast *summon greater demon* without expending a spell slot, you can choose to cast it at the level of your highest Fel Arcanum.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

> ##### Demonic Metamorphosis
> Some demonology warlocks that choose Pact of Sacrifice take on the fel features of their sacrificed demons, growing howns, claws, even tattered wings, their bodies wreathed in shadowy energy.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

### Destruction
Destruction warlocks are masters of chaos who call down fire and fel to burn and demolish enemies. They are well-versed in discharging a dizzying array of shadow, fel, fire, and chaos magics that rattle souls and conflagrate bodies.

#### Expanded Spell List
As a specialist in destruction, you may choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Destruction Expanded Spells
| Warlock Level | &ensp;Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | &ensp;*heat metal*, ✦ *living bomb* |
| 5th | &ensp;*fire ball*, *protection from energy* |
| 7th | &ensp;*fire shield*, *wall of fire* |
| 9th | &ensp;*destructive wave*, ✦ *pyroblast* |
<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

✦ <i>spell found in chapter 5</i>

#### Eradication
When you adopt this specialization at 2nd level, you learn one damaging warlock cantrip of your choice, which does not count against your number of cantrips known. Your damaging warlock cantrips deal an additional die of damage.

#### Havoc
At 6th level, when you cast a spell that targets only  one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can use this feature to target a second creature in range with the same spell.

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, *hold person* cast at 3rd level or higher is not eligible, but *conflagrate* is.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Chaotic Energies
Beginning at 10th level, the chaotic energies you harness improve the destructive potential of your spells. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, the spell's damage dice increase in size by one step; d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, and d10 to d12. If a spell already deals its damage in d12 dice, they don't increase any further.

<div style='margin-top:620px;'></div>

#### Unleash Chaos
When you reach 14th level, you may use your action to hurl a roaring bolt of chaotic energy towards a target within 120 feet. Your target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes force damage equal to 5d12 + twice your warlock level, which ignores resistance and immunity to force damage. In addition, roll a d6 to determine what condition the target suffers until the end of your next round.

- 1: The target is blinded.
- 2: The target is charmed.
- 3: The target is frightened.
- 4: The target is incapacitated.
- 5: The target is knocked prone.
- 6: The target suffers two conditions. Roll twice more, rerolling any 6.

On a successful save, the target takes half damage and suffers no additional effects. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Versatile Weapon Fighting
When you are wielding a single versatile weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon.

In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to AC if you are wielding that weapon with two hands.

### Second Wind  
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your warrior level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Action Surge  
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### Rage 
Also at 2nd level, you learn to harness the fury of battle to unleash devastating techniques on your foes.

#### Rage Points
You start with 0 rage points and gain one rage point at the beginning of each of your turns in combat, which you can spend on special maneuvers detailed under "Rage Maneuvers" at the end of the warrior class description. You gain an additional rage point at the beginning of each of your turns at 6th and 14th level.

Your warrior level determines the maximum number of rage points you can have, as shown in the Maximum Rage Points column of the Warrior table. Out of combat, any unused rage points disappear after one minute.

#### Rage Maneuvers
You know a small number of special techniques called rage maneuvers which you can use in battle. All rage maneuvers cost two rage points to use and are declared when you hit a target with a weapon attack, unless otherwise stated in the maneuver's description. You can only use one maneuver with a single attack, with the exception of Heroic Strike. 

You begin by knowing two maneuvers of your choice. You also know the Heroic Strike maneuver, which does not count against your number of maneuvers known. You learn additional maneuvers at the levels shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the Warrior class table. Each time you gain a warrior level, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your rage maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
<font face='scalysans' size='2'>
 
<center> 
 
**Rage maneuver save DC** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
 
</center>
 
<div style='margin-top:-8px'></div>
 
<center> your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) </center>

### Warrior Specialization  
At 3rd level, you choose a specialization which enhances your combat styles and techniques. Choose Arms, Fury, or Protection, all detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement  
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack  
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

### Indomitable  
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.

## Warrior Specializations 
Different warriors choose different towards the art of war. The specialization you choose reflects your approach.



### Arms 
Arms warriors are battle-hardened weapon masters, using mobility and overpowering attacks to strike down their foes.

#### Size Up 
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Insight skill.

Additionally, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

- Strength score
- Dexterity score
- Constitution score
- Armor Class
- Current hit points
- Total class levels (if any)
- Warrior class levels (if any)

#### Tactical Brilliance 
Also at 3rd level, you are able to quickly adapt to the changing battlefield. You can take the Disengage or Help action as a bonus action on your turn in combat.

In addition, the first rage maneuver you use on your turn costs one less rage point (minimum of one rage point).

\columnbreak

#### Arms Techniques 
While all warriors can use their rage to fuel special combat maneuvers, at 7th level you learn how to use more potent martial techniques. You can use this feature two times, selecting any of the options listed below, and regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. You gain an additional use of this ability at 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

***Colossus Smash.*** After you make a successful weapon attack you can use this technique to rend your target's defenses. The next time that creature is hit with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage.

***Heroic Leap.*** You can use your action to leap up to your speed towards an unoccupied space, which doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Each creature within 10 feet of you when you land must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes thunder damage equal to 2d12 + your warrior level and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

***Overpower.*** When you are hit by a weapon attack but before damage is rolled, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC. If this causes the attack to miss you, you can immediately make one weapon attack against your attacker as part of the same reaction, if they are within range of your weapon.

#### Titanic Might
When you reach 10th level, you can empower your weapon strikes with titanic strength. The first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your warrior level.

#### Seasoned Soldier 
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Arms Techniques remaining, you regain one use.

#### Battle Shout
When you reach 18th level, your commanding presence can sway the tide of battle. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry that emboldens your allies. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you are freed of any effects causing the charmed or frightened conditions. These creatures also gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Fury 
Fury warriors are furious berserkers who unleash a flurry of attacks to carve their opponents to pieces.

#### Furious Mien 
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Intimidation skill. Additionally, you can always choose to make Intimidation checks with Strength rather than Charisma.

#### Berserker's Grip 
Also at 3rd level, you can use two-weapon fighting even when the melee weapons you are wielding aren't light, as long as they do not have the two-handed property.

In addition, whenever you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you gain one rage point.

<div style='margin-top:550px;'></div>

#### Rampage 
At 7th level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with reckless abandon. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

#### Titan's Grip
When you reach 10th level, you can wield even larger weapons one-handed. You gain the following benefits:

- When wielding a versatile weapon in one hand, you may use the two-handed damage die.
- You may wield a two-handed melee weapon in one hand, treating it as a one-handed weapon. You have a -2 penalty on attack rolls made when wielding a two-handed weapon this way. 

#### Bloodthirst
Starting at 15th level, your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit against a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack, you regain hit points equal to 1d6 + your Constitution modifier.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:550px;'></div>

#### Berserker Rage
At 18th level, your fury has made you an implacable force of destruction. After you Rampage, you have advantage on saving throws until the beginning of your next turn.

### Protection 
Protection warriors are stalwart protectors who use their shield to safeguard themselves and their allies.

#### Vigilant 
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Perception skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Perception checks made to detect creatures attempting to hide from you.

#### Threatening
Also at 3rd level, you know the rage maneuver Taunting Strike, which doesn't count against your maneuvers known. Taunting Strike no longer prompts a Wisdom saving throw and always affects its target. Once on your turn, you can use Taunting Strike with no rage cost.

\pagebreakNum

#### Intercept
When you reach 7th level, you can react quickly to selflessly protect your allies. Whenever an ally within your movement speed is attacked by a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed to within 5 feet of the ally and force the attack to target you instead. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Until the beginning of your next turn, all attacks made against your ally have disadvantage while you remain within 5 feet of them.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Sword and Board
Beginning at 10th level, you are an expert at using your shield for defense as well as offense. You gain the following abilities:

***Shield Block.*** You can use a bonus action to assume a defensive stance with your shield. You gain the benefits of half cover until the beginning of your next turn.

***Shield Slam.*** When you take the Attack action while wielding a shield, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with your shield. This attack uses the same ability modifier as your primary attack. The damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals bludgeoning damage.

If your shield offers an additional bonus to AC above its normal bonus, you add the additional bonus to the cover bonuses of Shield Block, and the attack and damage rolls of Shield Slam.

#### Safeguard
When you reach 15th level, whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you is subject to an attack roll made with disadvantage, even if that attack hits, its damage is halved.

#### Survivor
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

## Rage Maneuvers 
Unless stated otherwise, all maneuvers cost two rage points and are used when you hit a creature with a weapon attack. The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Charge
As a bonus action, you can use this maneuver to move up to your speed toward a creature that you can see, which doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You must end this move closer to the creature than you started. If this maneuver is used in your first turn of combat, it generates two rage points instead of costing rage.

#### Cleave
Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

\columnbreak

#### Defensive Strike
Until the beginning of your next turn, the first attack roll made against you each turn has disadvantage, provided you can see the attacker.

#### Demoralizing Strike
The damage of your target's next melee attack before the end of your next turn is halved.

#### Disarming Strike
Your target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop one item of your choice that it is holding; the object lands at its feet.

#### Dull Pain
When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can spend one rage point to gain resistance to the attack's damage against you.

#### Forceful Strike
If your target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

#### Hamstring
Your target's movement speed is halved until the end of your next turn.

#### Heroic Strike
After you roll damage with a weapon attack, you can spend one rage point to reroll the weapon's damage dice and use either result. You can spend additional rage to use this maneuver additional times on the same attack.

#### Intimidating Strike
Your target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened by you until the end of your next turn.

#### Mortal Strike
Your weapon attacks, including this one, ignore your target's damage resistances until the beginning of your next turn.

#### Pummel
If your target makes a concentration check as a result of this attack, they have disadvantage on that roll.

#### Sunder Armor
The next attack roll made against your target before the end of your next turn is made with advantage.

#### Taunting Strike
Your target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn. This maneuver can only be used with melee weapon attacks.

#### Victory Rush
When you reduce a hostile target to 0 hit points, you can spend one rage point (no action required) to gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + your warrior level (minimum of 1). You can use this maneuver at most once per turn.

# Chapter 3: Equipment
This chapter presents additional items and rules pertaining to equipment specific to *Warcraft 5E: Champions of Azeroth*. This chapter supplements chapter 5 of the *Player's Handbook*, which is still where you'll find information on most of your character's items and equipment.

## Starting Equipment
Instead of the starting gold and items granted by your class, you may choose to start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and purchase equipment directly.

#### Starting Wealth By Class
| Class  | Funds|
|:---|:---:|
| Druid | 3d4 x 10 gp (75 gp) |
| Hunter | 5d4 x 10 gp (125 gp) |
| Mage | 4d4 x 10 gp (100 gp) |
| Paladin | 8d4 x 10 gp (200 gp) |
| Priest | 2d4 x 10 gp (50 gp) |
| Rogue | 3d4 x 10 gp (75 gp) |
| Shaman | 5d4 x 10 gp (125 gp) |
| Warlock | 2d4 x 10 gp (50 gp) |
| Warrior | 8d4 x 10 gp (200 gp) |

## Weapons
Azeroth contains several unique weapons not presented in the *Player's Handbook*, from the elegant glaives of the night elves to the deadly rifles of the dwarves. Some of these weapons are detailed below.

\columnbreak

> ##### Acknowledgments
> The firearms presented here are a simplified version of the comprehensive firearms rules written by [Mage Hand Press](https://store.magehandpress.com/), available for free on the [Middle Finger of Vecna](https://mfov.magehandpress.com/2018/04/firearm-rules-redux.html) blog.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

### New Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the weapons table. In addition to the weapon properties found in the *Player's Handbook*, several new properties are listed below.

***Firearm.*** All firearms produce a loud boom, audible out to half a mile. Unlike other weapons, you don't add your ability modifier to the damage roll of a firearm unless otherwise stated. Firearm ammunition costs 2 sp per shot, and cannot be recovered once used.

***Returning.*** When you make a ranged weapon attack with this weapon and do not roll a natural 1 on the attack roll, it returns to you at the end of the attack.

### New Weapon Descriptions
Several new weapons and their special traits are listed below.

#### Blunderbuss
Common especially among dwarves, the blunderbuss is a firearm with a short, large caliber barrel which is flared at the muzzle. Blunderbusses are especially deadly at close range.

***Special.*** If you make an attack with a blunderbuss against a target that is within half its normal range, you deal 2d8 damage instead of its normal damage dice. In addition, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on ranged attack roll with a blunderbuss.

<div class='classTable wide' style='margin-top:-320px'>

##### New Weapons
| Name | Cost | &ensp;Damage | Weight | &ensp;Properties |
|:---|---:|:---|---:|:---|
| *Simple Melee Weapons* |  |  |  |  |
| &emsp;Warclaw | 15 gp | &ensp;1d6 slashing | 3 lb. | &ensp;Light, special |
| *Simple Ranged Weapons* |  |  |  |  |
| &emsp;Blunderbuss | 50 gp | &ensp;2d6 piercing | 8 lb. | &ensp;Ammunition (range 40/160), firearm, loading, <br>&ensp;special, two-handed |
| &emsp;Pistol | 75 gp | &ensp;2d4 piercing | 3 lb. | &ensp;Ammunition (range 30/120), firearm, light<br>&ensp;loading, special |
| *Martial Melee Weapons* |  |  |  |  |
| &emsp;Throwing glaive | 25 gp | &ensp;1d6 slashing | 3 lb. | &ensp;Finesse, light, returning, thrown (30/90) |
| *Martial Ranged Weapons* |  |  |  |  |
| &emsp;Rifle | 150 gp | &ensp;2d8 piercing | 8 lb. | &ensp;Ammunition (range 80/320), firearm, heavy,<br>&ensp;loading, two-handed |
<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>
</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Pistol
Pistols are small firearms designed to be wielded in one hand, paired, or even adjunct to another melee weapon.

***Special.*** You can engage in two-weapon fighting with a pistol and another light weapon. When you do so, if you make your bonus action attack with a pistol, you subtract 2 from the damage roll of the bonus attack (minimum of 1).

#### Rifle
Rifles have longer barrels than pistols, making them more difficult to wield, but with greatly increased range and power.

#### Throwing Glaive
Not to be confused with the polearm of the same name, these versatile blades can be used in melee or thrown at enemies, where they return to their wielder seconds later. Throwing glaives are especially favored by night elf warriors, though other elven races and trolls are known to use them as well.

#### Warclaw
Warclaws are common among orcs, shaman, and others who revere the savage wilds. While most warclaws consist of several curved talons extending from a simple grip or gauntlet, some use a single long blade, a sharpened metal ring, or other exotic designs.

***Special.*** This weapon requires an action to don or doff. While donned, you can't be disarmed of it and that hand is considered empty for the purpose of using objects or performing somatic components for spells. You can't wield a weapon or hold a shield in the hand that is using a warclaw.

\columnbreak

## Adventuring Gear
This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

***Ammo pouch.*** This leather pouch can hold up to 20 rounds of firearm ammunition, such as bullets, shells, or shot.

***Shamanic totem.*** A shamanic totem is a carved piece of wood, bone, stone, or other material, designed to channel the power of the elements. A shaman can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook*.

<div class='classTable' style='margin-top:40px'>

##### Adventuring Gear
| Item | Cost | Weight |
|:---|---:|---:|
| Ammo pouch | 1 gp | 1/2 lb. |
| *Ammunition* |  |  |
| &emsp;Firearm rounds (20) | 4 gp | 2 lb. |
| *Holy symbol* |  |  |
| &emsp;Libram | 10 gp | 5 lb. |

# Chapter 4: Customization Options
While the preceding chapters present plenty of character options for a complete and satisfying game setin in Azeroth, players and DMs might wish for more. This chapter briefly discusses a number of optional rules DMs may choose to adopt for their games: variant rules concerning character creation and advancement; multiclassing requirements for *Warcraft 5E: Champions of Azeroth*; and a large number of new feats specifically for this setting. These rules are **optional**, and DMs decide whether they are available in your game.

## Languages
The languages most likely to be encountered by *Champions of Azeroth* characters are listed in the Languages tables below; a more comprehensive list can be found on [Wowpedia](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Language). Additional languages will be listed in future supplements.

##### Common Languages
| Language | Races |
|:---|:---|
| Common | Humans, Alliance races |
| Darnassian | Night elves |
| Dwarven | Dwarves |
| Gnomish | Gnomes |
| Gutterspeak | Forsaken undead |
| Orcish | Orcs, Horde races |
| Taur-ahe | Tauren |
| Zandali | Trolls |

##### Rare Languages
| Language | Races |
|:---|:---|
| Draconic | Dragons |
| Eredun | Demons |
| Kalimag | Elementals |
| Nerglish | Murlocs |
| Ogre | Ogre |
| Titan | Titans |

## Variant Rules
Some of the following variant rules are adapted from those presented in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, while others are original to *Champions of Azeroth.*

### Character Creation
The character creation rules of *Champions of Azeeroth* were designed to be more flexible than standard 5E. Still, players may wish to create characters that break with cultural or racial stereotypes. This section presents several changes to character creation to support such concepts, or just give more control of the character creation process to players.

\columnbreak

#### Customizing Your Origin
While the Ability Score Increases traits of *Champions* races offer some flexibility, they still create optimal and suboptimal race/class combinations. DMs that wish to encourage the widest variety of character concepts may decide to allow the "Customizing Your Origin" rules from *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, either partially or in full.

#### Customizing Racial Trait DCs
Many racial traits require a saving throw, with a DC determined from your proficiency bonus and an appropriate ability score modifier, as usual. For all the reasons listed previously, DMs may wish to change or eliminate the specific ability dependence. You could allow any ability, or---the official recommendation---set the DC equal to 12 + your proficiency bonus.

### Character Advancement
5E has a strict notion of character advancement, in which most advancement choices are permanent when made. Many DMs are more flexible, however, acknowledging that players can make mistakes and that characters can change over time. This section presents variant rules codifying that philosophy.

#### Retraining
With your DM's permission, you can change decisions made during character creation or advancement: proficiencies, class features, even your choice of subclass. Your DM can decide when they think this is appropriate, but a good recommendation is when your proficiency bonus increases. Your DM might insist on a period of downtime for more significant changes.

#### Improved Ability Score Improvements
DMs that wish for a higher-powered game that allows for more character customization might use the following variant version of the Ability Score Improvement class feature.

***Ability Score Improvement.*** When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or increase one ability score by 1 and take a feat of your choice. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

This does result in more powerful characters, so DMs should be prepared and balance their games accordingly!

#### Epic Capstones
Reaching 20th level is an amazing accomplishment both in-character and out-of-character. DMs that wish to further reward this amazing milestone might consider adding the following 20th level feature to each class.

***Heroic Paragon.*** Also at 20th level, two different ability scores of your choice increase by 2, as does the maximum for these scores.

\pagebreakNum

## Multiclassing
The rules for multiclassing are described in chapter 6 of the *Player's Handbook*, and can be used with *Champions of Azeroth* classes if characters meet the prerequisite ability scores shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. Characters that multiclass gain the proficiencies shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

#### Multiclassing Prerequisites
| Class | &ensp;Ability Score Minimum |
|:---|:---|
| Druid | &ensp;Wisdom 13 |
| Hunter | &ensp;Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Mage | &ensp;Intelligence 13 |
| Paladin | &ensp;Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |
| Priest | &ensp;Charisma 13 |
| Rogue | &ensp;Dexterity 13 |
| Shaman | &ensp;Wisdom 13 |
| Warlock | &ensp;Intelligence 13 |
| Warrior | &ensp;Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |

#### Multiclassing Proficiencies
| Class | &ensp;Proficiencies Gained |
|:---|:---|
| Druid | &ensp;Light armor |
| Hunter | &ensp;Light armor, medium armor, shields, <br>&ensp;simple weapons, martial weapons, <br>&ensp;one skill from the class's skill list |
| Mage | &ensp;— |
| Paladin | &ensp;Light armor, medium armor, shields, <br>&ensp;simple weapons, martial weapons |
| Priest | &ensp;— |
| Rogue | &ensp;Light armor, one skill from the class's <br>&ensp;skill list, thieves' tools |
| Shaman | &ensp;Light armor, medium armor, shields, <br>&ensp;simple weapons |
| Warlock | &ensp;— |
| Warrior | &ensp;Light armor, medium armor, shields, <br>&ensp;simple weapons, martial weapons |

Note that multiclassing is **not encouraged** for *Warcraft 5E: Champions* content. Even moreso than in standard 5th Edition, these classes tend to have significant, impactful features in their early levels, making multiclass "dips" disproportionately powerful. Instead, the Multiclass Feats section of this chapter presents an alternative approach to obtaining features from other classes.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

> ##### Reminder: Your Game, Your Rules
> DMs, don't be afraid to change any of the rules or content in *Champions of Azeroth* to better fit your own game. You don't need my permission!

\columnbreak

> ##### Acknowledgments
> A number of feats were inspired by or adapted from the following publicly-available resources:
>
> - [Additional Feats (CaelReader)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DkGWc3E6jkhs8dGieishdFrx1SoSGHeY/view)

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

## Feats
As detailed in chapter 6 of the *Player's Handbook*, feats are an optional way of enhancing your character. In addition to the feats from that book, this chapter provides a number of additional Warcraft-inspired feats for characters. Feats other than those presented in the *Player's Handbook* may be used with the permission of your DM.

### Close Combat Spellcaster
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You're adept at casting spells in the thick of combat. You gain the following benefits:

- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged spell attack rolls.
- Your spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you.
- You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll from the druid, mage, priest, shaman, or warlock spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip depends on the spell list you choose from: Intelligence for mage or warlock; Wisdom for druid or shaman; or Charisma for priest.

### Close Quarters Shooter
You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. You gain the following benefits:

- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
- Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you.
- Once per turn when you make a successful ranged weapon attack against a target within 30 feet of you and roll damage, you can reroll the weapon's damage dice and use either total.

### Heavy Ranged Expert
You can use the strength and range of heavy ranged weapons to dispatch your foes. You gain the following benefits:

- Attacking a prone creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
- Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets greater than 30 feet away from you.
- Once per turn, when you make a successful ranged attack with a heavy ranged weapon against a target greater than 30 feet away from you and roll damage, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice an additional time and add it as extra damage of the weapon's damage type.



\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:375px;'></div>

### Light Ranged Expert
You are practiced in the use of light ranged weapons, and can use them to strike quickly and unexpectedly in combat. You gain the following benefits:

- You can draw a hand crossbow, pistol, or shortbow as part of an attack you make with the weapon.
- Once per turn when you make a ranged weapon attack, you can move up to 5 feet as part of the attack, before you make your attack roll. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
- When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow, pistol, or shortbow you are holding. If you make this attack with a pistol while engaging in two-weapon fighting, you do not subtract 2 from its damage roll.

### Metamagic Initiate
*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Through innate talent or arduous practice, you have learned how to twist and augment your spells in potent ways. You gain the following benefits:

- You learn two Metamagic options of your choice from the sorcerer class (detailed in the *Player's Handbook* and *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*). You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless the option says otherwise. Whenever you reach a level that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one of these Metamagic options with another one from the sorcerer class.
- You gain a number of sorcery points to spend on Metamagic equal to your proficiency bonus (these points are added to any sorcery points you have from another source but can be used only on Metamagic). You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:375px;'></div>

> ##### What About Metamagic Adept?
> In a game without the sorcerer class, a feat granting metamagic can afford to be a bit more generous than the Metamagic Adept feat from *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*. That feat still exists, however, and can be taken for additional metamagic options and sorcery points.

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

### Stronger Than You Look
*Prerequisite: Small size*
<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You are able to wield massive weapons despite your small stature, to the surprise of your enemies. You gain the following benefits:

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You have continued your warrior training, and gain the following benefits:
- You learn an additional rage maneuver of your choice. You can replace one of your maneuvers whenever you gain a level.
- You can use your rage maneuvers a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). You can use at most one rage maneuver in a turn, and regain all uses of this ability when you finish a short or long rest.

# Chapter 5: Spells
C*hampions of Azeroth* follows the same rules for magic and spellcasting that are presented in the *Player's Hanfbook.* It's not the objective of this project to adapt every Warcraft spell faithfully into 5E rules; mostly the existing 5E spells have been sorted into their most relevant *Champions* classes, with new spells created where there isn't a good match for something important, or where there's a major need. For simplicity, this project uses spells from the 5E *Player's Handbook*, *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, and *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*. DMs, feel free to add additional spells, or change these spell lists altogether, at your discretion---you might have a different idea of what spells belong to which classes!

<div style='margin-top:24px'></div>

> ##### Spell Sources
> Spells without superscript can be found in the 5E *Player's Handbook*. Marked spells come from the following sources:
> 
> - XGtE: *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*
> - TCoE: *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*
> - CoA: *Champions of Azeroth*, presented later in this chapter

## Spell Descriptions
The spells are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Acid-Bite Blade
*Evocation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (5 feet)
- **Components:** V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
- **Duration:** 1 round
___
You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and becomes coated in corrosive bile until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly attacks a creature other than the caster before then, it immediately takes 1d8 acid damage, and the spell ends.

This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 acid damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for attacking increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

#### Agony
*1st-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You are limited in the actions you can perform and can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. Your gear melds into the new form. You can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of your equipment while transformed.
